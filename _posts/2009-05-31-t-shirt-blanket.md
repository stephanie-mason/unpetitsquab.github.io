I've been super busy graduating from college lately, and while I've still been doing a ton of crafts I haven't had time to update my blog! Also-my camera broke. This is something I discovered right when I was about to take pictures of some stuff to post, so that was a bummer. But I got a new camera (thanks to my awesome brother!) and no longer have any college work to hold me back so I will soon be posting everything to catch up. But for now I just wanted to post something that I was super happy to create, because its my first sort of foray into quilting which is something I've been hoping to try for awhile now. I just get a little intimidated by the whole idea, because I tend to lose interest in things quickly. But here it is, a t-shirt blanket made for my BF.

Mostly its old band t-shirts (some of them bands my boyfriend was/is in) with the exception of an outsider folk t-shirt (which were a set of shows my boyfriend helped organize) and the summer vacation t-shirt, which is a shirt that is made by our awesome friend Mike based on a concept started in part by my boyfriend (the concept being live your life like its Summer Vacation :) The squares are sort of randomized because I originally had it all laid out nice and organized like, and then my boyfriend came out and handed me two more t-shirts. I couldn't figure out a way to make it look nice and symmetrical, so I decided screw it-I'm just gonna place them haphazardly and then make sure it looks sort of nice after that.

A closeup of the back side. Its lined with some plain ol' broadcloth, because broadcloth is very inexpensive (plus it was on sale) and I like how soft it is.I got the idea from both the book *Generation-T* and *Sew Everything Workshop*, and I had sort of planned on doing something like this for awhile (my boyfriend was always complaining that he had too many t-shirts and wanted to get rid of the, but I knew he was hanging on because of sentimental value) so when he mentioned that someone on Viva La Vinyl (the message board he frequents) had made one made for them by their girlfriend I was like, "Yeah, I'll make you one." It's sort of a late birthday present, because I'm still in the middle of what was supposed to be his birthday present, which is an embroidered guitar strap. But alas, embroidery also takes a long time, and that whole interest level issue I have... well, lets just say its probably not gonna be finished until his NEXT birthday, haha.
