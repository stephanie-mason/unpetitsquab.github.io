A few months ago I made this blue dress, using the [BurdaStyle sewing pattern "Cate."](http://www.burdastyle.com/pattern_store/patterns/cate)

I actually made this dress a few years ago out of much crappier fabric, and wore it a few times before getting rid of it. I am much happier with the fancier blue version.
