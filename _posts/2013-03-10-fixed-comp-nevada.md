I mentioned that I broke my computer screen.

Buuummmeerrrr. Nice composition, though. (To quote a friend.)

Well, $50 and two business days later I got a replacement screen in the mail. Three minutes of youtube and maybe eight minutes of some minor fiddling, and I got it fixed right up!

So that was great. Remember guys, fixing things is easy and way cheaper than replacing them, so get handy and do it yourself!

On that note, I have been without computer for the weekend, so I'm a teensy bit behind on my image editing and blogging. However, I have some great things in store for the next few days.

Something that is very exciting, which I will post about a bit here, is that I am going down to Henderson, Nevada to visit my grandparents and my mom is gonna drive over from Long Beach. I haven't seen my mom in way too long, so I am super duper excited to hang out with her! It's going to be very fantastic.

I also have a small back log of projects I've been needing to get up here.

So stay tuned for updates that are more exciting than my cracked and then fixed computer screen!
