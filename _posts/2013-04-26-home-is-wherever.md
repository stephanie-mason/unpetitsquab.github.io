I am a pretty unromantic person, most of the time. I am usually more of an eye roller when it comes to sweet sentiments than someone who is particularly touched. Cheesy quotes are not really my thing.

However, there is something that will, for whatever reason, gets me every time. I have no idea why, but it's little kids singing songs. The first time I ever heard Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zero's "Home" was when it was sung by [this little girl and her dad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L64c5vT3NBw) on YouTube. Of course the song had already been super popular and overplayed at that point, but I didn't know that, because I don't listen to the radio or watch TV or hang out with normal people most of the time.

So I've quietly but not secretly loved that song since, love it every single time I hear it. I mean how can you not? Sooooo sweet.

I've had the idea of doing a little embroidery project with the main lyric for awhile, and I finally did. I've done some embroidery in my day, but I tend to get a little overzealous with the projects, and get burnt out on the whole thing. I knew I just needed to keep this one simple. I'm pretty happy with the finished project, as cheesy as it is, and inspired to do more embroidery soon.

I mean what is a house without a "Home Sweet Home" type embroidery? And aside from "Home is where the Vardo Is" (which I almost fell back on in my nervousness about actually using a cheesy lyric in on a cheesy embroidery project) there really isn't a more poignant way to express it. We've lived in the Vardo for almost a year now, in four different locations. Things are constantly changing and situations are never really certain when you're still figuring things out and living in a home made trailer. But wherever we end up, I feel like I'm home because I'm with the ones I love.'
