I've been super busy knitting in the last month and a half, and have gotten many many gifts done. I'm still finishing up a few things (even though Christmas has passed, I'm still catching up!) but here's a nice long post of some of the gifts I managed to get done on time!

One of the first items I finished was this Shrug from *Fitted Knits* by Stephanie Japel for my friend Xandria. It was made with Canson Simply Soft yarn, a really cheap and quick project that came out beautifully

I made my mom a sweater (Also from *Fitted Knits*) from a mix of Cascade Pima Cotten and some Sugar n' Cream kitchen cotten I had in my stash

For my friend Maria I made a pair of Arm Warmers out of Charcoal Cotton Ease using the pattern Evangeline by Michelle Szeghalmi on Ravelry. They're a little lighter in real life than they look in these photos.

My good friend Vi received the Bainbridge Scarf (also from Ravelry, but with a stitch pattern from the Vogue Stitchionary)  in grey heather Wool-Ease

My G-Ma in Colorado got some new wash cloths for Christmas. I had knitted her some years ago, and figured it was time for some new ones

I asked my friend Honnie what she wanted for Christmas, and since she recently moved to Berkeley from Long Beach for school and is adjusting to cooler weather, she asked for a pair of gloves. I used the pattern Knotty Gloves by  Julia Mueller on Ravelry for these bad boys, and some yarn left over from a sweater I'm working on for my boyfriend

And for my boyfriend's Step Mom and Dad, I made a few horizontal Scarves. The purple and red one was made using a woven stitch pattern (as seen on DIY Network's Knitty Gritty) and the grey/green one was crochetted using a ribbed stitch. Both are made from Knitpicks Wool of the Andes.

These aren't all of the holiday gifts that I've completed, but I have to get some more pictures off of my camera and onto my Flickr! I'll post the rest later this week most likely. And I'll start keeping this thing updated with works in progress as well! I've been on a big knitting kick lately, so that;s what's probably going to dominate my posts, but I recently worked on some none-knitting but knitting related projects while visiting my dad in Washington last week, and I can't wait to post some pics of those as well!
