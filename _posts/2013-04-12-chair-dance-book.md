A project I was very happy to be included on recently was one that my good friends [Della](http://dellamoustachella.blogspot.com/) and [Wren](http://www.blogduwren.com/) put together.

Della is a totally hilarious and amazing circus performer, and one of her acts that she has performed and honed for the last few years is a satirical act called "The Chair Dance," in which she comically follows along to verbal instructions on how to chair dance, doing all the sexy things the instructions say but in very literal ways that do not translate to what one thinks of when they think of chair dances. Her partner and she recently had the idea to make merch for this act in the form of an instructional booklet. The two of them worked together on the writing, and Della approached me to do the illustrations.

I was, of course, pleased as punch to comply.

The result is a very funny short booklet that gives you some really good tips on how to do a chair dance, including how to choose your outfit, how to get into the right mindset, and the history of the chair dance. As you can imagine, it's pretty awesome.

If you are interested in ordering one, contact della {at} bellinghamcircusguild.com. It's definitely worth a read, and you get to see my illustrations! She'll also have them available soon on her [up-and-coming website](http://dellamoustachella.com/).
