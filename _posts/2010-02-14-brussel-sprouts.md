Brussel sprouts are one of my favorite foods. Seriously, top 3. Also high on my list of delicious things are soy sauce, sriracha, garam masala, and garlic. This simple recipe makes use of all of these things. These brussel sprouts are the bees knees.

I came up with this nice little side dish when I was at my dad & step mother’s house not too long ago, when I was put in charge of making the brussel sprouts and improvised with delicious things. My dad has Mitsukan citrus seasoned soy sauce which I am convinced is the best soy sauce on earth. However, I am usually too lazy to go to the Asian market to buy some so when I make this dish at home I usually just use some lemon juice mixed with regular soy sauce as a meager substitute. I’m going to assume you will need to do the same. Another thing to take note of is how spicy you make these. I like things fairly spicy, but not too too hot.  You can easily adjust to your personal taste.

Oh, and when I make this, I don’t really measure out these things. I just kind of eyeball them in a little dish and taste test until its good. So these measurements are guestimations. Alter the sauce until it tastes like something you want to eat.

Igredients:

* 1lb brussel sprouts
* 1 tsp olive or canola oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tsp lemon juice
* 1/2 tsp rice vinegar
* 1 tsp chili sauce (adjust for your preferred spiciness. I like sriracha, but you can whatever hot sauce you like best)
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1/4 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp lemongrass

First, throw those brussel sprouts into a bowl of water to rinse em’ off. Cut the hard little butts off, peel off any of the nastier looking outer layers, and cut them in half symmetrically. Throw them into a medium or large frying pan with the oil, and cook over medium heat for about 3-5 minutes until they start to get a nice toasty brown color going.

In the meantime, prepare the sauce by combining all of the other ingredients in a small bowl.

Once the brussel sprouts are looking toasted, maybe even a tiny bit burnt if thats your thing, pour in the sauce. This will get quite steamy and noisy, and thats what you want. We’re braisin’ these babies. Let them cook for another 2-3 minutes until all of the sauce is dried up and the sprouts are looking a little withered.

Serve those puppies up, and ENJOY omg yum.
