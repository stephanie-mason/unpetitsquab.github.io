More armwarmers! Never can get enough armwarmer action on this blog.

I’ve been knitting a lot of these things lately. Trying to build up stock for selling at the Pacific Arts Holiday Market. Also selling these babies on etsy.

I also just set up a (more public than my current) twitter and a facebook page in relation to my blog. I’ll put stuff on those pages linking back to here, and vice versa. Trying to diversify my internet presence and such. (Aka shamelessly self promote. Yayy!)
