Before we moved out of our last place, David asked Jason if he could build the front gate that he'd been procrastinating on for awhile. He already had this nice fencing in place, so Jason built a gate that had the same sunburst situation going on and installed it. It came out so beautifully, and pretty much all I've ever posted on here about Jason's projects before are the small ones  he puts together with scraps so I really wanted to share this nice finished, polished project of his. I'm always blown away by what he whips out.
