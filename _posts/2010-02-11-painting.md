The blog is coming along nicely, looking nice and everything. I still have a few minor tweaks to do.

Here is a drawing I did a couple weeks ago. I already posted it on my facebook, but I also wanted to post it here as my first illustration for my blog.

It is an original character I’m thinking of calling Annette, should I do future pictures of her. It was done in Photoshop CS2. Its got some things wrong with it, but overall I’m pretty happy. I haven’t finished a computer drawing in a long, long time. I plan on doing more.
