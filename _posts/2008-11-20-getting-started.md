This is my new crafting blog. I’ll be posting various sewing, knitting, crochet, felting, and other projects here. If I do any artwork I’ll post it here too, though it will probably be a bit more rare (though art is really more my forté, I finish those projects even less often than I finish crafting projects!) Its a bit rough right now, but eventually I’ll probably make it look a little nicer. Tweak the HTML and whatnot. Right now I’m busy crafting for the holidays. I’ll be posting pictures of those goodies very soon! In the meantime, here are a couple of my favorite sewing projects that I’ve done in the not so recent past:

A laptop cozy, made with some awesome green twill that has velvety printing on it. I love it. And to make it even better? Pink lining.

I made it using general instructions from Sew Everything Workshop by Dianna Rupp for the sewing machine cover, but modifying it for a laptop. I actually make a sewing machine cover also:

A long time prior to these sewing projects, when I was still working on my mom’s old, old (awesome, but difficult to use for someone who is not that adept at sewing) sewing machine I made this wallet. I would like to make more of them, because it was not that difficult and it is very cute, but I have a hard time getting motivated to work on these sort of detailed oriented projects.

Its got a change pocket with a snap, as well as several credit card slots. Its made of regular old quilters cotton, with lots of interfacing to make it fairly sturdy. The octopus on the front is appliqued on.

That’s it! Sometime soon I’ll also post a felting project I did this last year of my dog Franki. It was my first attempt at needle felting, and came out pretty decently. But now I’m off to knit!
