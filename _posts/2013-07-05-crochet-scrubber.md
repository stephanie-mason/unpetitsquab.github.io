Today I bring you a free pattern for a crochet dish scrubber! I made these up for use in the vardo sink because they are nice and small, easily washable, and because as much as I love the idea of knit/crochet wash cloths, I hate actually using them. Since I whipped the first one out so quickly, I made a few more and wrote up the pattern. Super easy, but a fun little quick project, they make a great housewarming gift.

# Scrubbies Crochet Pattern

![scrubbies](/uploads/2013/07/scrubbies.jpg)

You will need:
* 1 Skein Linen or Cotton Yarn (one skein will make several, I used Fonty Majorque)
* A crochet hook a few sizes too small for said yarn (I used a size B (2.25mm))

To make these scrubbies, you will crochet two different circles separately and then crochet them together around the edge. I prefer to start my circles with the magic loop, like this:

## First Circle (Fancy)

![fancy](/uploads/2013/07/fancy.jpg)

Make a loop. Ch 3 into loop.

Rnd 1: 1 petal in ring [(yo, insert hook, draw up a loop) twice, yo, draw through 5 loops, ch 1], make 7 more petals in ring, sl st in top of beg ch

Rnd 2: sl st to 1st ch sp, ch 3, 1 dc in 1st ch sp, ch 2, (2dc, ch 2) in each of next 7 ch sp, sl st in 2nd ch at beg

Rnd 3: sl st to 1st ch sp, ch 3, (1dc, ch 1, 2 dc, ch 1) in 1st ch sp, (2 dc, ch 1, 2 dc, ch 1) in each of next 7 ch sp, sl st in 2nd ch at beg

Rnd 4: sl st to 1st ch sp, ch 3, 2 dc in 1st ch sp, ch 1, (3 dc, ch 1) in each ch sp around, sl st in 2nd ch at beg.

Rnd 5: rep rnd 4, fasten off.

## Second Circle (Plain)

![plain](/uploads/2013/07/plain.jpg)

Make a loop. Ch 3 into loop.

Rnd 1: 11 dc into loop, sl st into top of beg ch

Rnd 2: ch 3, 1 dc in sl st, 2 dc in each dc of rnd 1, sl st in top of beg ch (24 sts)

Rnd 3: ch 3, 2 dc in next dc, (1 dc in next dc, 2 dc in next dc) 11 times, sl st in top of beg ch (36 sts)

Rnd 4: ch 3, 1 dc in next dc, 2 dc in next dc, (1 dc in next 2 dc, 2 dc in next dc) 11 times, sl st in top of beg ch (48 sts)

Rnd 5: ch 3, 1 dc in each of next 2 dc, 2 dc in next dc, (1 dc in next 3 dc, 2 dc in next dc) 11 times, sl st in top of beg ch (60 sts)

## Connect the Circles

![hold-together](/uploads/2013/07/hold-together.jpg)

Hold wagon wheel and circle together with beg of rnds lined up. Work a rnd of sc through both the front and back circles, increasing as fol:

Connecting rnd: ch 2, 1 sc in each of next 3 st, 2 sc into next st, (1 sc in next 4 st, 2 sc in next st) 11 times, sl st through front and back beg ch, fasten off.

The front and back will not line up perfectly, and you will end up skipping a few of the wagon wheel sts. You will also want to crochet around the chains of some of the wagon wheel sts. As long as you keep the two pieces lined up and crochet into each of the circle sts, you should be just fine. This is a dish scrubber, not a doily for the queen of england, it should be okay if there is some wonkiness.

Enjoy your new little dish scrubber.
