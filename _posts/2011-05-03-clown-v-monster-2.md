You may have noticed that in the video from my last post, I am wearing the tutu and bloomers from the two posts previous to that. Because I made them for that skit.

What I also made is that freaking sweet monster costume. Here are some photos, which are easier to see than the video.

It changes faces. From grumpy to happy. I am so dang proud of that thing. (Though I cannot take credit for the suit… that was Chipp’s to begin with!)

Inspired by/made from the instructions contained within [this](http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=130774.0) craftster post
