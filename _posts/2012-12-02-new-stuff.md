Hey everyone, check out my spiffy new website layout... including that new header image I spent about 30 hours painting!

I have officially crawled out from under the rock I have been living under for the last six months. I have Internet access again! I am also unemployed. In between time spent looking for jobs, I have been spending tons of time leveling up as a nerd. This doesn't just include getting into Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, Minecraft, and Magic the Gathering, but also finally cracking down and doing something I should have done a long time ago... learn how to use dang wordpress.

You see the thing about me is I am not what one would call a perfectionist... but I am a bit anal about customization. For a long time I assumed that in order to be happy with a wordpress site, I would need to make a theme from scratch so I'd have total control over how everything looked and behaved. I spent many hours teaching myself the basics of PHP, and wordpress theme coding. I learned a ton! I totally understand the basic ins and outs of wordpress themes now, and I even began coding a basic theme that I was going to work up into something awesome. Then I realized that making a wordpress theme entirely from scratch would be a huge waste of time.

I found this awesome <a title="Pinboard Theme" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/pinboard" target="_blank">pinboard</a> theme, and went in and did some minor changes to the CSS (way easier to deal with than PHP) to make it look more how I want it to, and voila... A way more functional and purdy website than I could possibly come up with on my own.

I also decided to rename my blog, because I'm over having the same name as a variety of industries seemingly related to paper products and food services. Un Petit Squab was a name Cramps and I came up for our crafting booth last December, and I couldn't think of anything better so I decided to go with that. It is sort of whimsical and silly, which is great.

My plan now is to expand a bit on what I was blogging about before. I'm still going to be writing about things that I finish (knitting projects, sewing projects, etc) as well as have Chicken Friday esque posts about everyday things and especially pet things. I plan on getting into some training with my new dog (who I'll be posting about soon) and I would love to start talking about that here too. And of course I should probably update the three people who cared about the chickens on their status.

Altogether I want this site to be more all encompassing of my interests, and with how wordpress is set up adding new content will be more integrated and all that.

Here is to a new era in my blogging life.
