For the last four years I have been going down to Oregon Country Fair in July and it is, quite simply, my favorite place in the world. Once a year I get to experience pure magic in a variety of art forms and a wonderful, huge community. The first year I went it absolutely changed my life--my whole perspective on what I wanted out of life and what I wanted to do. Each year I go back I get to make new friends, see amazing new art, and just have a generally awesome time. It is very refreshing and very inspiring.

This year was no exception. Here are just a few highlights from my trip there this year, some favorite moments and favorite people at The Fair doing their thing.

One of my least exciting fair attires ever, but still worth noting.
