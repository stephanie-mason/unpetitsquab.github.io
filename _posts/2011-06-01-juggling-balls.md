Juggling balls. For me.

I already made a set for my brother several months ago (MISTAKE. His juggling skills are now quickly surpassing those of many guildies and juggling club attendees alike. I’ve created a monster.) but I never posted about them.

I’m about to start mass producing these puppies for saleage. The pattern comes from another guildie and amazing juggler (and his awesome lady) and can be found at juggleballs.amielmartin.com
