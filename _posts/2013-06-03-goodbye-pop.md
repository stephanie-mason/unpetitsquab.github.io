Last week was a sad week. My family lost a dearly loved one, my grandfather Fred. Though he lived a long and good life and was ready to go to a better place it was hard for us to let him go. He has only been a part of our family for a few years and in that short time he not only became dearly loved but impressed all of us with how far he went out of his way to get to know each end every one of us individually (we do _not_ have what one could call a small family), how he made each of us feel important to him, and how happy he made my Nana on a daily basis. He was absolutely the most loving and kind man I've ever met.

It definitely reminded us all to love and appreciate the time we have with each other, and I couldn't be more grateful for having such a wonderful and close families. Both of my families get together regularly, and here in Bellingham my dad-family (the big, extended one) all get together several times a month. Holidays bring us even closer together. They are, every single one, amazingly loving people and I am a superbly lucky girl to be a part of it and have as much support to fall back on when times get tough.

Goodbye Fred, and thank you for everything you brought to the Masons (& Robinsons, & Rehfeldts, & Taylors, & Hougens, & Von K<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif,serif;">Ã¼</span>hns, & Davidsons, & Rieders, and, of course, Starrs.) You will be missed, and will never be forgotten.
