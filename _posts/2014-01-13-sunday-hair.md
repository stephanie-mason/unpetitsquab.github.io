This is how I wore my hair on Christmas. While the dye job is a little sad, I was still happy with how the braid came out what with the pink on the bottom and the purply-grey faded crap on top. Thankfully I re-dyed my hair the day after Christmas so it will look a lot better in upcoming photos.

I'm planning on regularly sharing some of my hair-dos with you here on Sundays this year. I'm looking to experiment and share what ideas and tutorials I've found and probably also photograph a few of my own. I'm hoping that this will also help keep me motivated to keep growing it instead of succumbing to the siren call of short hair.

There is going to likely be a lot of braiding involved.  My hair is finally getting to the length--after a few years of being quite short--where my options for braiding are becoming vast. When I was little and had super long hair (fun fact: I cut my hair for the very first time when I was 13), I always loved having it braided up. Now that braids are back in vogue, I couldn't be happier because there is nothing more delightful to me than creating something beautiful with good ol' manual dexterity. They also appeal to me because I don't like using much in the way of hair products (aside from hair dye, obviously) or using too much heat on my hair. With braiding all you really need is a good quantity of bobby pins and ideally slightly dirty, unwashed hair. Check and check.
