So many unfinished projects, so little time.

Meanwhile, I bring you photos of Shanks. Cause who doesn't love cute dog pictures?

For those of you who don't know, Shanks is Jason's parent's dog. Well, she is technically Jason's dog, but she really is happier having a warm house with nice cozy laps to watch tv on in the evenings than any number of precarious living situations Jason has found himself in-- trees, islands with lots of predatory birds, houses with deck gaps so big her little legs would fall right through them...

That is all for today. More better blog content to come soon, I swear.
