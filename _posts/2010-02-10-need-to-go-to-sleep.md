Here is the new blog design! I am pretty satisfied. I still need to add stuff to the black box there, change that old picture to something better, update the description, etc. But everything over here on the left is pretty much in place as far as I can tell.

It came along a lot quicker than I thought it would. All the tumblr programming thingies took me a little while to figure out, but I’m happy I know what I’m doing now because if I want to tweak or change it in the future I’ll be prepared.

Now I must go to sleep. I am going to be so grumpy in the morning, ugh.
