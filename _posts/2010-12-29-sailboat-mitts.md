I haven’t updated in awhile because all I’ve been making lately is presents that I didn’t want to post before giving to their recipients. But its after Christmas, and now I can post the ones that I actually managed to finish on time.

However, being the poor blogger I am, I haven’t photographed most of the things I’ve already made. So I’m going to slowly post them as I get back in touch with them :) I also have some haute trash fashion that I made and modeled like a month ago that I need to get up on this sucker. God I am a terrible blogger.

In the meantime, these are some convertible armwarmer mittens I made for my new manfriend actually not for Christmas but for his birthday. Well, NOW they’re convertible mittens. When I took the pictures I had yet to make the mitten part. So imagine the above, with a foldover mitten top. I actually don’t like the way the tops came out anyway because they’re big and loose and feel weird when you’re wearing them, so I’m going to reknit those… maybeeventuallywe’llsee.

The mitten pattern is from [ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/space-invader-converti-mittens), but the sailboat design is all mine baby.
