Happy 2013 everyone! I am so excited to start the new year, I have lots of concrete goals for this year including weekly and monthly project goals. One of these is to update my blog not only more, but most week days. I want to start treating this like part of a job, because I would like to start making a living being self employed and I see a my blog as being part of successfully reaching that goal.

To kick things off I'm starting some new regular updates about everyday stuff. I did these sort of posts for awhile, they were called Chicken Fridays, but as the chickens have mostly hit the back burner (some literally, some figuratively) in my daily dealings I am going to begin touching on other fun things. These posts will probably coincide with projects I have in progress or that I want to talk about but aren't a big enough deal to have their own separate post, and whatever other interesting or uninteresting things happen to pass. I want to do these posts also to keep in touch with family and friends, who might be curious about what is going on in my life but who I don't get a chance to talk to all the time. I'm also hoping it will keep me inspired to keep updating my blog, since these posts can be very open ended.

To right get to it, this past week...

We dog sat. Calliope investigated very closely just what happens when dogs go to live with grandma and grandpa.

I went to a new years party with my lovely sister. I got dressed up fancy and put on makeup for about the fourth time this year, to good result! I do have to admit that I left the party early to spend the rest of the evening *cough* err... nerding out with my SO playing Magic the Gathering.

Yesterday the SO and I did some good acro with our good friend, Mr. Chipps. He has been a pretty amazing friend and has been privately coaching us in lots of things. He did get a chance, also, to get his _whale_ on with SO as base.

And today the SO and I spent a few hours collecting downed wood to chop into tiny little firewood pieces for our super swank new tiny wood stove! (I will talk more about the wood stove next week.)

I chopped firewood for the first time in my life.

Franki, of course, patiently observed all the to-do from a distance.

And that was this past week! I now give you Calliope 'tocks, to help you get through _your_ next week. Cheers!
