Here is a scarf I made for my lovely sister in Vermont for Christmas. It is the knitty [lace ribbon scarf](http://knitty.com/ISSUEspring08/PATTlaceribbon.html). I sent it to her in mid February. I sent several Christmas gifts in mid February. If I’m on top of things, I’ll upload some of them in the next few days :)

So, March (apart from being awesome for being my month of birth) is National Craft Month! Which is perfect because I already decided that I’m going to really buckle down and craft like crazy in March to start selling things. For real this time. And with that, I’m going to make a concerted effort to update this blog with the things I do. No promises. But lots of potential.

Yaay crafts!
