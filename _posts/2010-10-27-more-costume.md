Another element of my costume I made yesterday. I am so stoked on how this turned out.

It is a vest from Goodwill, which I shortened and removed the collar from. Then, using various tutorials from the interwebs, I made a bunch of organza flowers and sewed them on.

I love this vest, and will be wearing it outside of my costume.

Inspired by this baroque wrap from etsy.
