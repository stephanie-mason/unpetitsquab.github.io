Oh my gat I am updating my blog. And with a picture of my bum no less! Lucky you!

I made these bloomers today. They are going to be part of a halloween costume (an unseen part, but important none the less!) as well as my new lounging around looking cute getup. I was jealous of my sister’s bloomers, so I had to make myself a pair. Mmmmm, bloomers.

(And as for the lack of updates—its been a busy, eventful summer and I haven’t done that much crafting. For shame. But I did do a few things, which I may end up posting about later. Or maybe not. And its getting colder now, which means I’m spending a lot more time indoors, and crafting will be happening. So yay.)
