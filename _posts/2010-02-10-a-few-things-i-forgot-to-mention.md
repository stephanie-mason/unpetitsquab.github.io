I will also be redoing the way this blog looks over the next few days. This layout is alright for now but it needs to look snazzier. Also, it needs to not make everything I type lowercase because that is stupid.

Aaaand I forgot in my last post to mention that I may also be oh crap what was it I forgot again ummm ummm ummm it had something to do with what else I may end up putting on this blog. I don’t know why I can’t remember. When I think of it I will make another post. Shoot.
