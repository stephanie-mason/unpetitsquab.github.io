I’ve made many a pair of tiny bloomer at this point. So many that I’m not even going to blog about them all. However, these are some other kinds of bloomers that I was commissioned to make for my sister and dear friend Kira.

The fabric is super soft, drapey, and comfortable. But the biggest pain in the ass to work with ever, so I unfortunately don’t really plan on continuing to make these.
