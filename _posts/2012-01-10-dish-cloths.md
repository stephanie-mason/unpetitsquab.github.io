My grandmother requested dishcloths for Christmas this year, so I made her some. I also made my other grandmother some (similar, but different!) dish towels. Both of my grandmothers are lovely, lovely women and it was fun to make them these practical but fancy gifts.

I also made myself some dish cloths, because they are super handy! And a great way to use up all this cotton yarn I seem to have randomly accumulated over the years…

(The warshcloths I made for my G-ma, which are the solid red and blue ones, are block’s from Nicky Epstein’s book Knitting Block by Block. The rest are patterns I improvised.)
