Last December a friend of mine asked me if Iâ€™d be interested in participating in the [Haute Trash](http://www.hautetrash.org/) fashion show that was going to be taking place at the Cirque Lab. I had remembered seeing this fashion show at Oregon Country Fair a few months before and was ecstatic to be a part of it.

I created the dress by fusing plastic bags together, and created the vest by knitting plastic bags. The only non-plastic bag element is a piece of elastic in the back which allows me to get the dress on and off.
