These are one pair of legwarmers I made for the lovely Jen of [Jen’s House of Chai](http://www.jenshouseofchai.com/) as part of a trade. I made them up on the fly, and if you look closely I fudged up the pattern ever so slightly in the stripes. So they don’t totally match up. But they are similar enough that they look like a set and perhaps only make me look like more of an artistic genius, BECAUSE they match without matching. Yes.
