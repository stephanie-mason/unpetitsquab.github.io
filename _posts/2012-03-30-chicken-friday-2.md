The chickens are growing quickly…

and oh my god spring is FULLY UPON US! Some naysayers may lament the rainy, windy, and cloudy days that have still been interspersed with the sunny nice ones. But I can feel it, it is spring. A few nights ago I was even walking around outside—without even wearing long underwear. Wearing a dress in fact! It was the first night bare-legged this year, which is exciting to me. The other day I was also wearing a t-shirt—ALL DAY! Amazing!

The chickens have also been getting to enjoy the sunshine, we have been taking them outside on the warm days and letting them peck around in the grass. They even ate their first worm the other day(!!!), which I was not fortunate enough to document as it happened while I was working at the yarn store.

I have also been pecking around in the grass, so to speak. This last Sunday was a quarry work party day. The “work” I did was walk around a field, gleefully barefoot, spreading grass seed with the gentle assistance of the breeze. Ahhh, work!

Well, I did help clean out the airstream kitchen (a little) as well as clean up around the property (a  little). I actually did do a lot of work here and there that day. But I also thoroughly enjoyed working outside as well as the sunny, beautiful day as a whole.

Then on Monday I got to do some crafting and sewing while my sweetie slaved away in the windy rain to build us a house! More on the house soon. More on my crafting, soon.

Now, back to the Chickens, who got some well deserved snugs after all that hard work eating worms and slugs in the grass.

That there’s the boys. At least as far as we can tell at this point. My gut has always told me that Charles and Lovefeather are boys, and that Bonnie, Astrid, and Jackish are ladies. I’m suspecting that the nameless chicken is also a lady. I don’t have much experience sexing baby chickens, but there is a certain amount of instinct that I believe goes into this whole thing. Lovefeather is undoubtedly a rooster at this point, though, and turning out to be a bit of prick rooster at that. He may not be long for this world if his personality keeps developing as it has been. Charles, on the other hand, is proving to be pretty sweet and may be the rooster who gets to stick around. Maybe. Charles may also prove to be a hen. Who knows?

That’s all for this Chicken Friday. More updates on all sorts of things to come.
