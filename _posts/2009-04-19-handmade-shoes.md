I’ve been cooking up some non-knitting crafts again! I’m working on an embroidery project for my boyfriend, and then today I got the whim (of really wanting some new shoes but not having a lot of money) to make these bad boys:

I’m so excited about them. They didn’t take that long, they’re super comfy (kind of like slippers), and they’re adorable. They have removable insoles, vinyl sole soles, and while the backs are a tad short, I definitely learned a lot making them and I will be making myself some more. They’re cheap too, while the vinyl and the padding for the insoles is a bit pricey, you don’t need very much and 1/8 of a yard of each is good for about three pairs of shoes. The plaid fabric cost me $.63 cents for 1/8 of a yard (though I’d probably get more next time, cause I had to piece it together which was a pain and took a lot of time. A fat quarter would have been perfect), the vinyl was $4.37 (again, good for 3 pairs) and the padding for the insoles was $1.87 (good for 3 pairs). I also used some plastic mesh in the insoles, to give them a little bit more stability while still remaining flexible. The lining fabric was just some I had laying around in my little stockpile. If I make 2 more pairs of shoes, I’ll have paid less than $5 for each. Wooot!

While I got some inspiration and direction from these [craftster](http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=274990.0) [posts](http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=35344.0), the pattern I came up with on my own by guestimating based on some shoes I already have.
