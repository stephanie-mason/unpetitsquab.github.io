This post is part me blogging about a creative endeavor, and part me shamelessly plugging the awesome circus show I’m going to be/have been involved in some production aspects of. Circus Supernova!!! Yay!

So I made this poster… I’ve been making a lot of posters for various people/events in the circus of late but most of them involved using other people’s photography or artwork. This one, though, is all me bebeh. I’m pretty proud of it.
