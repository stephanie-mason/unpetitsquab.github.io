#Gratuituous photos of goat birth to follow

If you hate nature then you might want to not look at these photos.

There have been (to quote David) painfully cute things happening around here lately.

This post is all about the baby goats that have been born in the past few days. These are all David's pygmy goats. (David is who we live with, the one who let us park our Vardo in his driveway and such) Honey is the lighter colored one and she had her babies the other night in the middle of the night. Then just yesterday we were standing outside just as David and his son got home, and Maple started going into labor! It was perfect timing, and so quick! She's an old pro, Honey is actually her daughter. She had three babies in about fifteen minutes, and got em all cleaned up super quick and has them up and romping! I am amazed at how these goaty ladies do it.

Anyway, I was able to photograph the whole process, so I have behind the fold here what some might consider way too many images of a goat giving birth. I think it's pretty awesome, but it may not be for everyone, so if you want to skip the slimey birth photos and go straight to the fuzzy and dry babies, scroll to the bottom after you get to Honey.

Without further ado, the kids!

Here are Honey's Babies, when they were just a few hours old!
