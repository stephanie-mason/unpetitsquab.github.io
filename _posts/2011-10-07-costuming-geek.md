Something you may or may not know about me is that I am secretly not-so-secretly a huge nerd.

This is a costume I made for Oregon Country Fair this year. Which, if you are not familiar, is not a renaissance fair or anything like that. But definitely a fun place to get dressed up.

Literally everything in these pictures I made, either from scratch or (in the case of the cape) through altering already made items. I made up the patterns for the hooded vest, the underbust tailvest, and the hot pants (accidentally the best things I have ever made). The blouse was some simplicity costume pattern for a nightie, which I altered to be a shirt. I made the headpiece and the vest closure as well, from random items found at the craft store.

Hot. Action. AmIRite?
