Between moving and not quite getting wifi set up, and being on a road trip with repeated failed attempts at accessing wifi, I have not quite been able to blog as much as I'd like the last few weeks! However, I do have some good posts lined up, and will be back on track soon. Meanwhile here's a little about the road trip I've been on with my sweetie and his mom down to see some of his family in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Jason, his mother Joyce, and I set out on Monday morning and on Tuesday evening found ourselves in Moab, Utah. The two of them really wanted to take me to Arches, and I can see why. It is quite a beautiful place. Unfortunately down in the south west it has been astoundingly hot, so we only spent a bit of the morning there before we took off to make the rest of the trip in to Albuquerque. Here are a few shots from the park:

It has been really nice meeting and spending time with Jason's family, they are all very sweet and generous people. I'm sure he and I have been driving Joyce crazy during the road trip down, but hopefully she'll still love us when we all is said and done and we all have Jason's sister & family moved up to Tacoma.

Yesterday Jason and I took a trip down to Carlsbad so we could see the caverns. We watched the bats fly out of the cave last night (disappointing in a sad sort of way, the drought is so bad not a lot of bats want to roost there, and an fungal infection is decimating the bat population in general, so not a huge swarm of bats flew out.) and this morning we went down into the caverns. Unfortunately I realized as we got down to the entrance that I'd left my stinking memory card in my lap top in the car, and figured it'd be too dark to take good pictures in the caves anyway. When we were down there Jason pointed out that I could have brought my tripod and taken some really nice long exposures, and I was disappointed in myself for having not thought of it, haha.. I'm sure they wouldn't have turned out great anyway, but it would have been fun to experiment with. Ah well, I had a really great time just looking around the caves... It is a pretty mind blowing place to visit.

We camped out on BLM land, which is a first for me, and it was pretty dang nice. Its so hot out that not a lot of people are up for camping it seems. We didn't see anyone on any of the little BLM roads we drove up. It couldn't have been nicer really, free camping with no one around! We slept out under the stars and they were freaking gorgeous. The crescent moon was so bright it kept us up a quite a bit of the night haha... That and the ants that we apparently decided to sleep on top of. Also wish I had thought to take some long exposures in the moonlight. (This was pre-cave, so at least I hadn't already been reminded of the opportunity.) Overall a very nice and memorable trip, if a short one.

We are hoping to catch the grand canyon tomorrow, but we'll see if we end up sticking with that plan. Jason and I are heading back up to Bellingham with his sisters dogs and are kind of just playing it by ear at this point. I am determined to get some nice pictures the next place we go.
