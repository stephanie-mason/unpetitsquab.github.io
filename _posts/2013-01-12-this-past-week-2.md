This week was a week filled with a lot of hard work! I spent a few hours each day helping a very nice local Luthier clean up her shop, move furniture, and paint some floors and a wall. In between doing that I spent some time with the SO, my wonderful brother, and his lovely lady clearing a big pile of wood chips in the pouring rain. Here he is with his black work hat breaking his back on our behalf.

And here he is in his green work hat, exchanging wheelbarrows full of wood chips with
Tasche!

They were so great to come out and help us, that I didn't want to spend too much time standing around taking photos and not doing my share of the work. But it was a good haul, and now we have a spot to park our vardo IN TOWN! That's right, we're gonna be townies again, as of Monday! We even get to live with adorable kids, both a human child and several baby goats! More to come on the baby goats, for certain.

I have also been spending a good deal of time this week working on things for the blog, including putting together a pattern that I have been working on for awhile, which will be available tomorrow! Here is a sneak peak.

This evening was my family's bi-monthly dinner night, in which whoever is available comes out to drink tasty home brewed beer, wine, and cider that my parents make, and eat my wonderful Step Mother Leslie's truly awe inspiring home cooking. As you can probably tell, I'm pretty lucky in the family department.

The most exciting part is that my eldest sister, Erica, is visiting from France for the next month! She just got here today! Woop woop!

And that is all for this week's update. Next week: Moving into town, starting dog-school with Calliope, baby goats, and more!
