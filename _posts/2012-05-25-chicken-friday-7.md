Last Friday, which was not a Chicken Friday on this blog, was bike to work and school day. AKA Bike Christmas, in which one can bike to the Hub and get free pancakes. And, if one has the right hookups, get these pancakes deep fried. Heck. Yes.

I biked in with Jason and our friend Isaac from the Quarry. I actually biked to and from work several times last week, and it was fantastic. The weather was nice, and I didn’t have to listen to crazy people on the bus. When I got to the Hub, I saw many friends and also my brother juggling.

And now, for the Chickens of Chicken Friday. They are all becoming very beautiful little chickens.

Charles is blossoming in to a very glorious albeit Napoleanesque rooster. He has the stature, he has the walk, he’s starting to get the crow, he is magnificent.

Lovefeather, on the other hand, has not grown since about week 8 of chickendom. I am not kidding. Here are some side by side comparisons of Charles and Lovefeather.

Charles is small, Lovefeather is tiiiiiiiny.

Tiny, tiny chicken. Not only has he not grown, but he seems to have not matured since week 8 either. He never really developed much of a cock’s comb, and he still sounds like a baby. All of the other chickens have had all the embarrassing voice cracks of puberty and have been developing some impressive little chicken warbles. Lovefeather still cheeps like a chick. Lovefeather also unfortunately got squished by our other, bigger chickens (which shall not be mentioned further on this blog due to “attachment issues” that I may or may not have to chickens I blog about semi-weekly) and has developed something of a limp. We have been watching him every day, though, and while he is sort of pathetic he seems to lead a pretty happy life. He eats, he sleeps, he poops, aside from his tiny stature and slight limp he is a pretty contented little chicken. So we are letting him be the contented midget he is.

Jason has high hopes that he will be our million dollar chicken, and that we will be able to breed a flock of teacup chickens. I have mixed feelings about introducing such a pathetic, miniaturized breed to the world, and also suspect that Lovefeather may just not have it in him to fertilize the ladies, but we shall see. We shall see.
