A few months ago my sweetie gave me an old trunk he didn’t have a use for. I think he got it from the goodwill for like $5. It wasnt in great shape. Not terrible, but pretty peely/rusty/a little moldy. I had a dream of making it into something beautiful. This is that dream come to fruition.

Sadly (stupidly) I neglected to take before and process pictures. But the finished product is something I’m very happy with. My sewing machine fits snug inside the empty space there…
