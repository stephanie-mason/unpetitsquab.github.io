This time of year the town always gets covered in fairy fluff as the cottonwoods release their soft cottony little catkins. When you look up at the sky there are so many in the air it can look like it's snowing on a clear warm day, and it can be quite ethereal. Then they like to collect curbside and in front of people's doors and get tracked everywhere, which is just a nuisance.
