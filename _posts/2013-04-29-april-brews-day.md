For the last three years, I have had the privilege as volunteering my time as an amateur circus performer (verrry amateur) for a local event called April Brews Day. This is an event in which many local and nearby microbreweries bring samples of two of their beers for the public to taste. It is fantastic advertisement/networking for these microbreweries, and excellent opportunity for people to sample beers from small breweries they might not otherwise know exist. Best of all, it is all a fund-raiser for the [Max Higbee](http://www.maxhigbee.org/index.html) center. This is a local non profit organization which provides recreational activity services for people with developmental disabilities.

I mean, how incredible is that? I get to go and mess around doing circusy stuff with my friends to keep people who are waiting in line from getting too bored, and in doing so I get to support this awesome organization, and I get to sample some super tasty micro brews to boot! (I don't know if you know this about me, but I am a beer fan. As far as alcohol goes, it's certainly my favorite form. Probably because I am so spoiled by the numerous local microbreweries, not to mention my dad's own home-brewing.)

Even though it has rained the last two years and I have gotten soaked/dirty from doing my ground acro shenanigans (at least I can blame slippery clubs for all of my juggle drops, right?) it has been a blast. Here are just a couple photos from this past Saturday's April Brews Day.

For the record-- this year my favorite brewery was Skagit River (they had the hoppiest IPA I've had in a long time, which was kind of intense but also very impressive in how flavorful it was despite the bitterness. They also had a pretty tasty and mild sweet/sour German Wheat.) I also really appreciated Tieton Cirderworks, their apricot cider was a nice light break in the bitter IPA and heavy, malty porter routine of my other samplings.
