Oh man. I am in love with my new serger. Last night I went through my unfinished projects box and finally took in the sides of a t-shirt that was too big (it took _less than two minutes)_ and I finally sewed the sleeves onto a shirt I had made but never finished ages ago.

But before that, I played around making this little guy:

Which is certainly not the fanciest or even most well done project I've ever made, but it's something I've been meaning to whip up for awhile, and check this out!

Bam! Serged edges on the inside, ain't that a thing of beauty?

To make it, alls I did was appliqu√© a rooster from some fabric I had around onto a piece of black felt, and freehand stitched the crow lines--again with the sewing machine. I then serged the top of the rooster felt to a piece of broadcloth, another piece of felt to another piece of broadcloth on the same short end, and then serged all four pieces of fabric wool sides facing on the three unserged sides. Twenty minute phone cozy, heck yes! I intended to put a flap on the top but realized too late that I put it on the wrong side, and also that it wasn't really necessary to have because it's nice and snug around my phone anyway.

Is this a project that _really_ required a serger? Of course not. You could easily make this yourself, in almost as little time, with only a sewing machine. And you should. And then you should tell me about it in the comments, because I'd love to see it!

Here's to no more scratches on my screen from putting my phone into the same pocket as my keys.
