Big announcement! Deadman Wonderland Circus tickets are officially on sale now. If you live in the Bellingham/Whatcom County area, you should definitely buy some tickets and come see us on March. If you live a little further South, in the Skagit County Area, stay tuned because we will also be doing shows at the Lincoln Theater in  Mt. Vernon!

Woo! I am not gonna lie, this production has been sucking up a lot of my time.

But in a good way! Not only have I been improving my circus skills, but I've been creating costumes, which is crafty and good.

I made this nifty tailcoat for my honey bucket, who is looking a little scary in this picture as he portrays his evil ringmaster character...

It still needs some details, like buttons and trim and things.

I also have been working on Chipp's Circus Bear costume for this show, which is sort of hilarious:

The fluffyness of the white part cracks me up. I accomplished this look by shredding strips of sheets and sewing them onto a shirt. And I winged the pants, which are incredibly bright and remind me of 1992.

(And how about those amazing socks, eh? Socks that I neglected to blog about before giving them away...)

Both of the costumes are still works in progress, as is much having to do with the show, but I figured I'd share what I got so far.

Expect a lot more [Deadman Wonderland Circus ](http://www.deadmanwonderlandcircus.com/)related updates in the coming weeks, as that is going to be consuming a vast majority of my time til we premier!
