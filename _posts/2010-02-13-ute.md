I just finished making Ute from BurdaStyle this evening. I had started it a few weeks ago, got stuck and/or lazy, stopped for awhile, and picked it back up this afternoon. I love BurdaStyle to death, for their free and cheap patterns, but I always seem to come to some point in their patterns where I’m like, “WTF? What does this meeeaaan?” Well after coming back to it I still couldn’t figure out what the hell I was supposed to do, so I just skipped a little part (which was somehow related to making the inside of the collar look nice) and then finished the rest of the shirt without looking at the instructions. This was easy because it was just sewing up a side seam, doing some hemming, sewing in the sleeves, and doing the buttons. Since I’d done all this when making the JJ shirt, I knew what I was doing.

Speaking of the sleeves and the JJ shirt—I modified the sleeves on this pattern slightly. Partly because I messed up when I was cutting them out, and partly because I didn’t like how poofy the sleeves were in all the finished projects shown on the BurdaStyle website (I like a little poof, but I have my limits) I sort of melded the sleeves from JJ and Ute together. I like the results. They’re a little longer than the JJ sleeves, as well as less work trying to sew that damn cuff on, but they have the nice subtle poofiness.

The fabric is a quilting fabric from JoAnn.

And here are some nice shots with a vest (really how this kind of shirt was meant to be worn, imo) and the collar tied a little differently.
