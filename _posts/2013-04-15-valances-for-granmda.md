It has been quite a busy visit! We have done a lot of driving and walking around here, with some thrift shopping and lots of activities getting my grandparent's new house all finished up. Thursday we went all over town finding fabric for some valances my grandma wanted me to make for her. I've spent the last couple evenings working on them here and there, and these are the results.

First kitchen/family room area. They looked like this before:

Which is not really my grandmother's tastes. She's not a fan of pink, and that particular shade of green just didn't really go with anything. Plus it was just too girly. So we found this fabric, and made some nice, plain, and simple valances that match the rest of the decor in her family room perfectly:

The bedroom valances looked like this before:

Again, just not my grandma's tastes. Way too pink. Thus:

I'm very happy with how those came out. I also made some simple ones using the same pattern for one of the guest bedrooms, it didn't have any valances before but here's what it looks like now:

All in all a success.

It has been a wonderful trip. It's always nice to see my grandparents, and it was awesome being able to hang out with my mom, who I hadn't seen in way too long.
