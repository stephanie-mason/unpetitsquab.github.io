Once upon a time… about two months ago… I had this costume birthday dance party with a fairy tale theme. I decided (pretty last minute) that I was going to be puss in boots, so I got some fabric from a thrift store, traced a romper that I have, and threw this costume together. And then I decided to blog about it two months later to keep up with the good blogging habits.

I… am a kitteh cat… and I dance dance dance and I dance dance dance.
