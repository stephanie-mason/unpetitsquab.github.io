I sent out my other craft swap goods (remakes), but I’m still waiting for my partner to get them before I post them. In the meantime, another food post!!! These are my sweet potato biscuits. I love them. I made them the other day at my sister’s house (she loves them too) and I decided I needed to post the recipe. They are awesome.

These are adapted from a recipe off of about.com.

I always make these (and just about everything else I bake, except cake type items) with half whole wheat flour because I like the way they taste better than when I make them with only all purpose flour. But you can do whatever you like.

Ingredients:

* 1 c all purpose flour + 1 c whole wheat flour OR 2 c all purpose flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* 3 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/8 tsp all spice
* 1/2 c margarine (Earth Balance & Nucoa are my vegan recommendations.)
* 1 medium largish sweet potato
* 6 tbsp soymilk

Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Get that sweet potato cooking. You have some options here. I like to microwave the thing whole, and then peel it afterwards, because its quick and keeps the sweet potato nice and moist. You could also boil it. Or cook it basically however. It just needs to be cooked, and you can tell its done when you can stick a fork in it and its all soft inside.

While it is cooking, combine the flour, salt, baking powder, brown sugar, cinnamon, and all spice in a large mixing bowl. Cut in the margarine using a pastry cutter, or if you don’t have one you can use a potato masher, and if you don’t have that you could use a fork. Or your fingers. They all work to varying degrees of convenience and quickness. Do this until the mixture is crumbly and nothing is much bigger than the size of a pea.

Once your sweet potato is done cooking and is all peeled and basically a hot pile of mush, put it in a bowl and mash it with the soymilk.

Add the mashed sweet potato to the flour mixture and mix until its all combined. Knead the dough a few times just to get everything consistent and work any extra flour in there. I generally just do this in the bowl.

Pull off chunks of dough if you want drop biscuits, or roll the dough into a log and cut off nice little sections if you want perfect little round biscuits. You can make them basically as big or as small as you want, but you’ll have to vary the cooking time a bit.

Put those babies on a baking sheet and bake for about 12-15 minutes (shorter if you’re making small biscuits, longer if you’re making gigantic biscuits) or until they’re on the golden brown side. If you made them with whole wheat (which you really should have) its kind of hard to tell, so just use you’re best judgement. Don’t over cook them, but make sure they ARE cooked because I have accidentally underbaked them before and it was gross.

Serve with some margarine. Delicious. If you eat honey, it goes well with these babies as well.
