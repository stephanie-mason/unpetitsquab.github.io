This past week was a big one. Lots of things going on. Lots of stuff to talk about. Many very stressful moments, which I am very glad to be done with, but also lots of great things happening.

For starters, I dyed my hair pink!

And boy am I loving it so far. It's a drastic move, but seeing as how I'm employing myself at the moment, I figure it's now or never.

The big move into town happened this week.

Like the other two times we moved it, I was incredibly nervous the entire drive.

The curves, of course, being the most heart stopping parts.

But all was well, and we and our (unfinished, as illustrated well in this next photo) vardo made it safe and sound to our new home.

Where we live with some adorable kids!

I'm really not sure if anyone can have enough pictures of baby goats so here are some more to satiate goaty appetites.

While we're on the topic of cute animals, I might as well mention that there was some good fetch action happening with the dogs all week long.

And Calliope started school this week! She is officially going to become a well mannered canine. No more muddy paws for you, miss! You're gonna be a proper lady dog.

Okay so we'll probably still allow some muddy paws. But at least since we started dog training classes at [Tails-a-Wagging ](http://www.tails-a-wagging.com/)on Tuesday, we'll be thwarting the jumping up with said muddy paws behavior.

It was also my big brother's 30th birthday this week! He doesn't like cake, so of course his lady friend and I conspired to give him cake real good, on stage at Vaudvillingham.

We also had some [Deadman Wonderland](http://www.deadmanwonderlandcircus.com) rehearsals this week, and are really cracking down to get the show tight and profesh. However, the show isn't perfect yet and unfortunately Mr. Chipps the Circus Bear gets most of the flak for this. He got a good yelling at by our ringmaster today.

Kai even went so far as to beat him with a stick due to his being unable,  in his exhaustion, to land a hat trick.

I can't blame him for wanting to run away.

I am, of course, kidding. These are all a scene from the show! And Kai doesn't even beat anyone with a stick, at least not in that scene.

Thats all for this week!
