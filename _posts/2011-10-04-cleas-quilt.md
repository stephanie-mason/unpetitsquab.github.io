Around a year and a half ago, my sister decided she wanted to get rid of a bunch of clothes. She was, however, having a difficult time letting go of her old t-shirts which she had sentimental attachments too.

I, of course, suggested she make a quilt of them, and promised her I would help since I had experience with these kinds of things. She, of course, thought I was a genius.

The two of us worked together for a couple of weeks putting together the quilt top. And then life happened, and before we could finish the quilt the quilt top got put away into a storage bin. Occasionally, I’d hear my sister talk about how she needed to finish that someday… or maybe pay someone else too.

I, of course, secretly snuck that quilt top out of that storage bin the day before her birthday and frantically quilted it. (After having planned to do this all year for her birthday, and then forgetting until the day before that it had been my plan all year.)

Here is the result. A lot of this quilt I do have to credit to my wonderful sister Clea. She is the one who had the awesome t-shirts, picked out the colors for the rest of it, and did quite a bit of the sewing for the quilt top. I still wanted to post about it here in my blog, though, because it is an incredibly awesome quilt.
