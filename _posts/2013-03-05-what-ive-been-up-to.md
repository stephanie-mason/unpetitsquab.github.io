Oh man! Has it really been since Valentines day when I last posted? I have been in a hole my friends. A hole that is called [Deadman Wonderland Circus](http://www.deadmanwonderlandcircus.com). Nearly every spare moment up until we opened this past weekend has been spent rehearsing and sewing.

But!

We have done our first three out of eight performances! The show is looking great, and I have to spend waaay less time thinking about it and working on it now that it is running. It has turned out to be a remarkable show that I'm incredibly proud to be a part of, so again, if you live in Bellingham or surrounding areas I urge you to [check it out](http://www.deadmanwonderlandcircus.com).

While I want to share more about the costumes and some things from the show, I still need to get better pictures of cast members (including myself) before I do that. Meanwhile, here is some exciting and also boring things that have been happening the last few weeks.

First of all, all of the guys in the cast worked hard to build this very impressive stage.

Underneath it's pretty beefy. Note that this picture is before bringing the stage to code, which means lots of insulation!

With five boys on board who are all quite savvy to various degrees on the ins and outs of wratchet drivers, table saws, and bracket joints but whose knowledge of sewing machines is pretty well limited to, "I can sew a straight seam if absolutely necessary..." and with my relative lack of fondness for sharp blades spinning at thousands of rpms and testosterone driven bossiness, I decided right off the bat to spend the majority of my time in the craft corner while that whole project was being completed.

I hand painted some fabric for one of the costumes. I also did lots... and lots... and lots of sewing.

In normal life, the Honey and I made some new friends.

Calliope graduated!

Still not quite a lady. But she can play dead!

Yesterday we got some things to finally start organizing and finishing the interior of the vardo!

I also got some early birthday presents!!! My incredibly gracious Nana got me this new camera:

Which is gonna make pictures on this blog soooo much nicer looking. Case in point, Franki's face:

And! And! And!!! My super sweet SO, who I can't believe is this good to me, got me a freaking brand new serger!

Holy crap, I can't wait to make some projects with this bad boy. Which is what I'm off to do now, and I shall share them with you all soon.

Cheers!
