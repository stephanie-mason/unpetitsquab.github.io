Alas, I have already broken my frequent posting resolution. However, not without good reason. I have actually been crafting fairly regularly in the last month or so, but I  have been doing a lot of things for CRAFT SWAPS! Also, I’ve had a lot of things going on in my life lately, so and I’ve been busy doing lots of fun stuff.

Anyway, I did not want to post pictures anything I’ve made for people until my partners received their goodies, in case they happened to check my blog.

Unfortunately, 75% of the things that I made for one partner fell out of her package before she received it. I have pictures of everything I made for her, but now I’m remaking things and don’t want to post pictures until she actually gets everything.

But here are the things I made for a dog swap!

They are a cushion, a no-pull harness & matching leash, and a doggy jacket.

The cushion I just winged, pretty simple. The Jacket pattern came from **One Yard Wonders**

The harness and leash I’m pretty excited about. I just sort of looked at my dog’s harness and bought some hardware and winged the pattern. I plan on making a few more for my dogs, and I plan on making a VIDEO TUTORIAL! I am excited to get this project underway soon.

And thats pretty much it for now! I will be posting more fun things soon.
