I have moved my blog from blogger to tumblr in hopes of updating more frequently. My thinking is that with the more user friendly interface and the general idea of how tumblr should work I will update more frequently with smaller posts about each project as opposed to putting everything off and then updating with huge multi-project posts. I always found blogger’s interface to be cumbersome and incommodious, so I kind of ended up dreaded blogging. This is what I’m telling myself to excuse my general lack of frequent updates.

Also, I like how tumblr is integrated with facebook. Since I’m pretty sure the only people who ever see this are people who are directed via facebook this is a good thing. Its possible that blogger also had this type of feature but I was too lazy to check.

Oh, one last thing thing, I will be expanding the general purpose of this blog to also include my artwork as opposed to just crafting (because I’ve been getting back into drawing & painting of late) and may also end up posting some inspirational things here and there, and possibly even some photos from my life every now and again seeing as how this is a tumblr and all and thats what folks typically do. I don’t intend to make this blog a full on journal or anything, as thats what my livejournal is for, but I would like to make this thing more lively in general.

So with that said, I give you a picture of our re-vamped painted area rug that I mentioned in my last post. Inspiration and instructions came from Martha Stewart. I used interior flat latex paint instead of acrylic, and I freehanded the design. It looks way way way better than my previous attempt, and because its got about 7 layers of paint & varnish its pretty sturdy and doesn’t flip up all the time. It also looks more finished, instead of like a painting tarp with some paint on it. So there you go.
