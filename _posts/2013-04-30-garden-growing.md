Amazingly, we have not only not killed the garden we planted several weeks ago, but it is thriving. Probably due in great part to the fact that Jason uses water from the big pot with gold fish living in it on days it's not raining--these plants are receiving lots of extra nutrients.

Jason had also planted this sad little tree which, believe it or not, is looking quite a bit healthier than when we first acquired it.

I mentioned before that I've never had a garden in my life, so this is quite the thrill for me.

How are your gardens growing this spring?
