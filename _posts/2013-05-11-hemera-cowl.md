This pattern has a few tricky parts- it is knit in the round with stranded color work but it also has short rows on the bottom. If you've never done short rows before, don't be afraid, they're not too difficult. However, knitting color work back and forth can be a little persnickety, so if you've never done fair isle knitting before just beware--I'm not saying you won't be able to do it, it just may present itself as a bit of a challenge. I'm all about challenging oneself, though! And I am always here to help you out if you get stuck.

And now for more photos, because they can say so much more than the words I type here.
