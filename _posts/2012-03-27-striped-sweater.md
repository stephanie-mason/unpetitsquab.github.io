Here is a sweater I made for myself at the start of the new year. And then re-made for myself from the armpits up. And then remade from the armpits up once more. And will probably modify just a tad (change the hem, lengthen the sleeves a tad) when I have the patience to do it. I designed it myself and knit it up out of two giant hanks of Perendale Wool. Sweet, sweet stripey action.
