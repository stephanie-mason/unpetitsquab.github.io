Here are the things I made for the “Spell my name” craft swap I participated in last month. My partners name was Tina. Tina just had a baby, so most of the stuff I made her was for her baby. These are all the things that I made once, and then made again.

For T, I made her Two onsies. I free handed the designs and used freezer paper to make stencils. I really love the bird + hearts ones, they turned out better than I could have hoped for.

Here was the first batch:

And then the remade batch, in which the owl onsie turned out much better because I learned from my mistakes. The lines around the eyes weren’t intentional, but liked the way they looked so I didn’t fix them.

For I, I made Itty Bitty Booties using this pattern.

And then I made them again, of course:

I used ribbons instead of buttons because putting buttons on anything for a baby just seems like a bad idea to me. I don’t trust my sewing enough to keep that button in place, and babies are strong!

For N, I made a Neck Strap, for Tina’s new camera (which I saw on her blog.)

And when I made it a second time, I made it adjustable!

Finally, I made some Assorted burp cloths for the A in her name. These were the only things that made it in the first package, so I didn’t have to remake them.

I really liked making this baby stuff. My bff from way back in the day is having a baby soon, and I plan on making similar type items for her baby boy! They’re so fun to do, because they’re instantly gratifying. Very small projects, always very cute, always very quick. Yes.
