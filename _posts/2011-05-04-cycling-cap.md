I made this hat. Like two weeks ago. This is why I’m a terrible blogger. I didn’t even THINK about posting it until today.

I’m trying to get better though! I’ve been thinking about my blog a lot and trying to think about things to post about! I do a lot of crafy stuff, I swear!

But I have gotten better. Just look at all this bloggy goodness of late.

Oh, I didn’t make this pattern. But I’m too lazy to link it. Just google “cycling cap pattern,” you’ll find it. It’s just an image, no instructions.
