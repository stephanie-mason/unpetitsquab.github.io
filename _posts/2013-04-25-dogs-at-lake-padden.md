After Calliope showed some interest in being in water, we decided a trip to Lake Padden (where there are a few dog-specific water access areas) was in order.

Franki jumps right in, she's always been a water dog. Calliope is less certain of the situation.

Calliope has reservations about this whole 'swimming' ordeal.

How'd you DO that?

She made it!

I had only tried getting Calliope to swim once before, at the Quarry, right after we got her. I don't think she's been swimming much in her life because she was very unsure of herself then, and still quite uncertain at Padden. She eventually jumped in, but not after quite a bit of worrying and reservation. She also doesn't really understand the concept of not breathing in the water, so she was generally coming back and hacking at shore... But towards the end she was getting the hang of it. I think by the end of this summer she'll be as much of a water dog as Franki, she definitely loves to stand in water/mud and cool off, so she'll probably get more excited about being fully drenched when she realizes the overall benefits of swimming after a ball.
