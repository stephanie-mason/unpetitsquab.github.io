Ahh, school started and I  started procrastinating. Already, and its such a new blog! I'll try to keep things updated fairly often, but I'm not making any promises. (This blog is currently mostly for me and some family anyway, and I'm sure they don't mind :)Anyway, here are the rest of the  Christmas goods! I still haven't photographed a sweater I made for my aunt, but everything else should be here. I also have a few other things I've finished, but I'm gonna post those another day so that there's something to look forward to. First off, some convertible glove/mittens I made for my boyfriend:

Made from the [Cigar pattern](http://knitty.com/ISSUEsummer05/PATTcigar.html) ala [knitty](http://www.knitty.com). The mitten part I just sort of winged it on, and I made all the fingers topless instead of just the first three (though I do like that idea as well.)

For my step mom (a fellow knitter,) I made some socks:

Using the [Hedgerow Sock Pattern](http://www.knittersreview.com/article_how_to.asp?article=review/profile/070823_a.asp) from Knitters Review. (I realize that the stitch pattern gets eaten in the variegation, but I still like the textured effect it gives them)

For my father, I made a different pair of socks:

(sorry for the crappy pictures on these ones, I didn't realize they were so bad until I was back in California and it was too late!)

These were done using the pattern [Thuja](http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEwinter05/PATTthuja.html) from Knitty.

For my step brother, by request, a neckwarmer that can be pulled over one's face:

Made using the pattern "Distinguished Gentelman's Neck Warmer" (lengthened a bit) from Ravelry.My step sisters Clea and Erica received arm and legwarmers respectively:

Both patterns from (you guessed it!) Knitty! [Manresa](http://knitty.com/ISSUEsummer06/PATTmanresa.html) and [Mosey](http://knitty.com/ISSUEspring08/PATTmosey.html). Manresa is a pattern for legwarmers,  which was kind of my original intent, but this was my first fair isle project and it came out a tad bit small. I didn't bother making a guage because I kind of figured I'd just block them to size. I think they make rad arm warmers anyway. All of the yarns used in these projects came from [KnitPicks](http://www.knitpicks.com/), except for the neckwarmer which was made from Cascade wool. The socks for my step mom were made from Essentials sock yarn, the socks for my dad were made from Swish DK, and everything else was made from Wool of the Andes worsted. Yay for awesome and affordable yarn!
