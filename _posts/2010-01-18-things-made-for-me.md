Somehow I neglected to take photos of things I made for people this year. I didn’t end up making things for everyone like last year, but I did do quite a bit of hand made gifting and somehow I don’t have pictures of pretty much any of it.

However, now that the holidays are over, I’m back to my selfish crafting ways. Here are a few projects I have completed for myself in the last few weeks!

The first is actually a project I started in the summer. I had kind of fallen into a knitting hiatus for awhile, so I worked on these very sporadically for a number of months. I finally got around to finishing them a few weeks ago.

They are based on the endpaper mitts pattern, but with a fair isle pattern from Jessica Tromp's website. I also knitted fingers instead of leaving them open.

Then we have the elbow length Farinelli gloves.

Funny story about these gloves, I didn’t actually follow the Farinelli pattern. Not intentionally, anyway. I saw the gloves when I looked at that issue of Twist Collective and thought, “Oh man those gloves are awesome, I’m going to have to knit myself some elbow length gloves.” But I never really thought I’d get around to it. Then I was invited to a themed new years party, and my sister and I were both going as flapper girls. I really wanted to wear elbow length gloves for my costume, so I decided to knit some. Being cheap and lazy, I didn’t download the pattern but decided to wing it and make some gloves using my knitting know how and a lace pattern from one of my stitch dictionaries. I searched for one I liked, and I remembered that there had been some sort of diamond thing going on with the Twist Collective gloves and I liked it so all the ones I had picked were sort of diamondy, and I narrowed it down to the twisty diamond one. After I got all done knitting the gloves, I happened to go back and look at the pictures of Farinelli to see how they compared and—woops! I had somehow managed to pick the exact same lace patterning that were on those gloves. So these are pretty much exactly the same, except they have a slightly different edge :)

Finally, from a pattern in my favorite Japanese needle craft book, I made this crocheted vest. It only took me this last weekend, but I’m definitely done crocheting for awhile. Crocheting really starts to take its toll on hands & arm after obsessively doing it for hours on end…

As a side note, you might notice in a few of these pictures that our living room looks a little different. Last weekend, my boyfriend and I spent the whole weekend rearranging the place, and I redid our area rug. I painted it with a much bolder pattern, and cut it down to a smaller size. It looks very, very nice. Maybe I’ll get around to posting some pictures someday :)
