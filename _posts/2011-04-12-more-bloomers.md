Bloomers bloomers everywhere! A while back I posted about the bloomers I made from collette patterns. I love this pattern so much, I decided to make more pairs! And there are more pairs to come! I even made a pair that’s longer.

I striped the fabric myself. I’m trying to work down my stash, and I had a bunch of white muslin and paint, and not a lot of money to buy new striped fabric. So there you go. I’m stoked on how they turned out.
