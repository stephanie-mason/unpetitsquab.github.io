![Pinned pigtails, a great style for short hair.](/uploads/2014/01/pinned-pigtail-tutorial.jpg)

1. Part your hair and put half of it in a pony tail holder or clip it out of the way. Take the tail you are working on and give it a few twists towards your front.
2. Wrap it around in the direction of the twist. Pull some longer strands down to create a ponytail looking shape.
3. Pin it in place with 2-3 pins
4. Fluff it out and wrap some strands of hair back towards the middle of the pigtail to create a messy bun look.
5. Once it is the shape that you want and sufficiently mussed, put 1-2 more pins in to hold everything in place.
6. Pull out the half of your hair you set aside and repeat the process.
7. If wearing a headband or other accessory, put that thang on.
8. Fix your bangs, pull out a few strands of hair near your ears, and make sure your pigtails aren't stuck under your headband.

This is how I generally do my hair when I decide to wear it in pigtails. Since my hair is short and also pretty thin, this generally makes for better looking pigtails than those that are just pulled into an elastic. It doesn't require anything fancy, just some bobby pins and if you want a headband. This works great when you have short hair, even shorter than my hair is now, because it helps fan it out and make it look a little longer. As there's not a ton of hair to hold in place it doesn't take a million pins or get too weighty and it won't give you a headache after wearing it all day. I used 4-5 pins on each side.
