The chickens have been steadily becoming more chicken-y.

Like Charles, the rooster.

Look at that glorious little rooster face!

Here are some of the other chickens.

The three chickens that you cannot tell apart, but I can. Kindof. In pictures its a little more difficult than in person.

The chickens have been spending a lot more time outside lately. This is because this last weekend, I learned how to use some new power tools and built this here chicken tractor!

I also painted that little coop that Jason made blue! The chicken tractor is not quite done, it needs a little Weasel-proofing-reinforcement. But I made it specifically to fit up snug to the chicken coop, and I’m pretty darn proud of how it turned out. It’s certainly not perfect or as well engineered as their little house there, but it is very sturdy!

Chicken’s hangin on the ramp.

The last few days here have been horridly rainy, torrential downpour rainy. But this last weekend was super sunny and very warm. I even got a sunburn! It came from working on chicken stuff in the sun all day.

I cannot tell you how much I enjoy spending sunny days outside at the quarry. When I moved out there, I sold my tv to my sister because I knew I wasn’t gonna have room for it. And I have to say, it’s quite funny how much entertainment one can find in the simple things in life when one does not have tv. Like watching chickens run around in the grass. For. Hours.

Or even better, ducks.

Ducks are the most hilarious creatures on this planet. Every time I see them waddling from place to place getting into duck shenanigans I smile, and this is very very often. Just the other day I was cleaning out the chicken coop, only to have the ducks show up seconds later to ravage all that I had spilled on the floor. Food radar, these guys have.

One of the ducks then found a dead mouse, which made it very happy. Unceasing entertainment, these ducks.

While I get most of my daily kicks watching birds be birds, I also enjoy sitting out in the grass with a cold beer and watch other non-tv owners get their juggle on.

Ah, the simple life.
