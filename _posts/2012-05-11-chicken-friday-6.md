It’s been a fairly boring few weeks. Mostly working at the yarn store, working on Night Captain, and tons of rehearsals for upcoming performance projects.

I’ll admit, I haven’t been spending a whole lot of quality time with the chickens. I haven’t got much to report on them this week.

Jason and I did, however, spend a whole day in the rain improving their chicken tractor!

(Ignore those little black and white chickens there… They do not exist! I swear!)

Weasel proof. Aww’ yeah.

The chickens have started exhibiting some pretty cute grown-up chicken behaviors, which is funny because they’re all tiny. Charles there has the very beginnings of his rooster crow. And the ladies have been taking dust baths at night in their coop. Super cute. Chickens in motion.

And that’s all for this abbreviated Chicken Friday!
