The finished costume! I am the Queen of Spades. My brother has my camera, so unfortunately these pictures are not the best. But I am satisfied. So satisfied.

Elements from the top down:

The crown is made of cardboard, I painted some maroon on it in streaks and used lace as a stencil then spray painted it black.

The vest, collar, and cuffs can be seen below.

The dress was my bridesmaid dress from my sisterâ€™s wedding last year, I just shortened it.

The sash is just made of muslin with an applique spade.

The socks and garters came from Sock Dreams.

There is also a really crappy petticoat that I kind of improvised on, and the bloomers are underneath there as well.

The shoes my sister gave me awhile back, they are awesome.
