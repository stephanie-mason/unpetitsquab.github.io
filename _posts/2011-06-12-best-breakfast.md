Let me tell you about my breakfast.

It is pancakes. Whole wheat pancakes. Smothered in rhubarb compote. Compote made out if freshly harvested rhubarb from my “garden.” (Aka the piles of rhubarb magically growing out of the compost.) There is also a smoothie. All of this to be enjoyed on this amazingly beautiful late spring morning in my amazingly beautiful backyard.

Not to brag or anything.

Rhubarb Compote

* 3ish cups of rhubarb cut into 1 inch pieces
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/8 cup water

Put everything in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and let simmer until the rhubarb is all soft. Serve atop your favorite breakfast baked good, ice cream, cream cheese, etc. Feel free to use more or less sugar depending on your love of tartness. Mmmm.
