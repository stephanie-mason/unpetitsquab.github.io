The project I am posting about today is one that I finished months ago, but never got around to putting on here. It is a shawl I made for my mother for her birthday, back in May. The pattern is [Holden Shawlette](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/holden-shawlette), which is available for free download on Ravelry. Modeled here by the sexy mannequin that resides at the yarn store I was previously employed by.
