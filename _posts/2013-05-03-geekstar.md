Today, I just want to tell you about a super awesome lady and her business. I have not so secretly had a pretty big platonic-crush on Claire since I first met her. She is basically the most awesome person I know. She is an amazing juggler, she is the best possible kind of geek, she is super crafty, she is very smart, and she is totally hot. She has made her living out of her small business [GeekStarCostuming](http://www.etsy.com/shop/GeekStarCostuming#), through her etsy shop and even more so through her vending at a variety of craft fairs and conventions. My partner and I vended at a craft fair with her the year before last, and she was super helpful and patient and gave us some great pointers for if we decided to continue craft vending in the future (which we haven't thus far, but I still have some of her tips on mind!) Her etsy shop is great, but if you ever have a chance to go see her setup at a craft fair I highly recommend doing so. Her booth setups always look so nice, and you really get a feel for how quality all of her accessories are.

Here are a few examples of things she makes.

 Did you know that I have an OoT tattoo? These are amazing.

So dang sweet!

Need I even say more?

The ears she makes are really, indescribably awesome. She made the bear ears Chipp wore in Deadman Wonderland Circus, and I was in awe at how cool they looked, how comfortable they were to wear (of course I had to try them on) and how well they stayed put. They are a worthwhile investment for any geek, truly.

If you love geeky, girly things, I highly recommend you check out her shop.

And! If you are in Northwest Washington I highly recommend you come to [Pacific Nerdwest ](http://www.pacificnerdwest.com/) May 10-12, as she will be vending there. (Not to mention it's gonna be freakin' awesome!)

Hope you have a great weekend!
