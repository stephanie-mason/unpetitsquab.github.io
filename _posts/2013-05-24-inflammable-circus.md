This weekend there is going to be some pretty amazing circus action going down here in Bellingham.

Tomorrow night at the Cirque Lab, some of my absolute favorite people are putting on and being in a circus fire show: Inflammable Circus. You heard that right-- a circus show, with lots of fire, and lots of rehearsed and polished acts by very talented folks. There will be people defying gravity with awe inspiring aerial acts, and jugglers defying gravity with firey sticks of death. Bonus! There will be a beer garden. Even better bonus! The whole show is set to live music by [Maria in the Shower](http://www.mariaintheshower.com/), and if you've ever seen a circus show with live music you know it is simply a magical experience. Therefore, if you live in Bellingham or surrounding areas it is a clear no brainer that this is the place to be on a Saturday night.

Here are some teaser shots taken at dress rehearsal by [Evan Kerl](https://www.facebook.com/EvanKerl), one of the performers and all around solid dude.

This show is going to take place outside in the parking lot, so remember to bring a jacket to keep yourself from getting a chill. Although with all that hot fire action, who knows if it'll be necessary?

But what's this? You have a child who has an early bed time and not to mention you are sorta kinda afraid of the dark and worry about catching on fire? Well then come down on Sunday afternoon instead! Just down the street from all the Sea to Ski festivities the Cirque Lab will be putting on hourly Vaudeville shows, and will have a beer garden that won't be packed to the brim with bros. Heck yes! Daytime circus entertainment and lots of awesome people to socialize with over a cold brew.

Hope to see you there!
