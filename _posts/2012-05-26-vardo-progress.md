Progress on the Vardo! While Jason and I have both been super busy working, we’ve still been trucking away at the building process.

First went on the roof, which is smoke grey corrugated plastic. It is fantastic, I am very excited about having it as a roof. We have plans for making a quilt out of Reflectrex (which I mentioned in the last vardo post) to insulate the roof. The whole rest of the thing is so insulated I think we’re going to have more of a greenhouse effect problem in the summer than heating problems in the winter. I do have a little bit of concern about condensation issues, but I guess we’ll have to see how that works out. In the meantime, it is completely magical sitting in there on a rainy day and seeing the world outside, not to mention be able to enjoy so much extra sunlight.

Then we got the whole thing covered in house wrap, and the last few weeks have been spent slowly getting the siding up! We decided to do the board-on-board paired with sanded plywood, and today I even got some of it painted! The boards we painted before putting up to help protect from water damage, and I need to do a final coat to cover up all the caulking/extra primer. The blue is only a single coat right now, so all in all the paint job is unfinished and looking pretty crappy. But I was so excited at how pretty it was that I just had to post some pictures.

That’s all for now!
