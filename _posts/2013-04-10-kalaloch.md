Here's a little update from the airport for you, some leggings I finally finished yesterday!

Hi. Don't mind me. I'm just a woman who knits herself pants and then photographs herself in knit pants and then talks about it on the internet. Not a weirdo at all.

I started these sometime last year (after, hem, somewhat drunkenly buying the pattern out of utter shock and excitement over how beautiful these knit leggings were) and set them aside because I didn't have enough yarn. (I knew I wouldn't, but I figured I'd pick some up along the way since the variegation would hide the dye lot change enough for my undiscerning tastes. I eventually picked up another variegated skein and then just used leftover yarn from socks to make the stripes and stretch it all out so I didn't have to add anything else to my stash.)

The pattern is [Kalaloch by Andrea Rangel Knits](http://andreaknits.com/kalaloch.html), and it is a fantastic and well written pattern. The shaping for the derrier is simply genius, and looks so flattering.

I made mine a little shorter than I probably could have--I was pretty worried about still running out of yarn, though I definitely had enough that I could probably give them an extra couple inches... but I kind of like the shortness. Also, I am pretty over knitting these. Not as much work as knitting a sweater, but certainly just as boring as knitting tall socks. and the yarn I used is a bit thinner than the pattern called for. Overall though, I used less than two and a half skeins of yarn. Not too shabby for some sweet shants!

I think these are the most comfortable article of clothing I currently own. I don't really know how I'll wear them, they're probably gonna be alright under shorts or something... the colors I chose just don't really match much haha. I _am_  just ballsy enough to wear them in public with no other pants, but I know my lovely SO would probably prefer I not do that too frequently ;) For now they'll just be my soft, warm lounge pants.
