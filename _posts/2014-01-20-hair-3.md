Of course, now that I've commited to regulary fancying up my hair and sharing photos of it I pretty much dislike everything I do with it. I hope that I can share more tutorials and more inspired hair styles from time to time, but I also just want to be able to be happy with my hair when nothing too exciting is going on with it and share that too.

I'm not a perfectionist when it comes to my hair on a day to day basis, so why should I be a perfectionist about it when it comes to my blog? There are plenty of things I can fuss over here, and my hair doesn't need to be one of them. I still want to do regular hair posts, but I'm going to allow that things will just get better with time and practice and not hold back in the earlier, futzier stages.

The hair posts are really more of a way to get away from my regular routine of just knitting and crafty related things, and I want them to be something I look forward to; not stress over because every strand isn't doing something awesome.

So here is a very simple, somewhat messy, but perfectly acceptable and cute french braid. Ladeda.
