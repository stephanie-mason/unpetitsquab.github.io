A few years ago, my lovely Step Mother Leslie made me a stained glass window with two swallows.

Did I mention that she is an amazing stained glass artist? You should check out some of her work on [her website](http://naturalglassstudio.com).

This was originally a window that was free hanging, to be placed inside another window. But the SO and I both decided that in the vardo, it would serve as it's own window. We procrastinated quite a bit on the installation because we wanted to properly frame it, and also have it be an opening window to access our water cotainter and sink and such from inside.

So we just had a big open square where the stained glass was supposed to go, and we stuffed that sqaure with a pillow for about five months.

Finally we got around to ordering a custom frame, and the SO installed the window in it's place with hinges and latch.

No we have a lovely work of art with an ornate frame displayed on the inside of the vardo...

That sneakily opens to the outside of the vardo.

And at night time, it lets out a beautiful ambient light so we don't kill ourselves walking off the back porch. Huzzah!

Thank you Leslie for the beautiful addition to our home.
