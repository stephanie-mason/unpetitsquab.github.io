Something that I am very involved in up here in Bellingham Washington is the [Lookout Arts Quarry](http://www.lookoutarts.com/). This is a magical, beautiful place where circus minded folk and friends live and work and put on spectacular events.

One of these events is the annual offroad soapbox derby SHâ€™BANG! in September. I was helping make carnival games for this event, and the one I was the most involved in was a little game called Small Game Hunter in which one would use a slingshot to shoot adorable baby animals. (Muahahaha.)

These are a few of the animals that I painted for this game.
