It is a beautiful day today. Sunny, clear, cold but happy.

I'd like to share this Duvet Cover I made today. It was comissioned by my parents, but I procrastinated so much on it that I turned my labor on the whole thing into a Christmas Present. It's actually one of the only Christmas presents I managed to finish on time this year, as I spent most of the hours leading up to the holiday frantically tucking away. (I'm still working on more than a few... ehheheh...)

I was very pleased with the results.

Leslie picked out the fabric, which is beautiful. I needed to figure out a way to expand it's length and width without just having an ugly seam. Also I've been trying to learn more fabric manipulation techniques, and so I decided to make tucked panels that would serve as the expansions.

Making the tucks was actually pretty fun to do. Each time a new one was folded over, it was like magic. They look so clean and crisp, I'm very pleased.

I also needed to figure out how to close the bottom. I was originally going to put on buttons, because I know a lot of covers close that way. But that would be a lot of button holing, and I wanted it to look cleaner than my button holes tend to turn out. I knew I did not want to use a zipper, because zippers always break eventually. So I decided to make these nice ties, and they came out better than I could have hoped as well.

Supposedly they've been doing a good job of keeping everything in place as well.

OH, and check out that super sweet piping...

Overall one of the more finished and professional looking projects I've worked on. I even preshrunk the fabric, so it shouldn't get all distorted when it's washed! Which is something I have neglected to do on the vast majority of my sewing projects thus far.

That is all for today. Hope ya'll are enjoying as nice of weather as I get to!
