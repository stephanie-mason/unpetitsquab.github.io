I have been in an armwarmer knitting frenzy. I’m sort of addicted to them in a way. I mean I’m making them to sell… but there’s also just so much you can do. They’re sort of like my sock knitting… Small, quick, portable, you can use any weight of yarn, you can do thumbholes or no thumbholes, you can make them more or less glove like, long or short, fitted or fat… They are a beautiful thing.
