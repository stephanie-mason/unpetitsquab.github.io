Oh my goodness, this weekend was fantastic! Lots of family time. Today I am just going to post a gratuitous number of photos of my family get together at my parents house on Saturday. A good portion of them are of my little cousin Kyler, who was hilarious and also easy to photograph- he was very good at stopping to pose for the camera. (I did manage to get lots of pictures of my three little girls cousins also, but very few of them were not of the back of their heads. They were very good at turning away the moment I snapped the picture!)

Some other great family shots in here as well, I hope ya'll enjoy them! And to my family members reading this, if you'd like any higher resolutions of any of these let  me know.  Also, while I have your attention, thanks for loving, supporting, and humoring your nutty niece/cousin. I know Jason and I must seem crazy to some of you at times, but you do a great job of not making us feel so ;)

These next pictures are the most hilarious thing in the world. Kyler was showing his mad/sad faces in an effort to earn more easter candy. He wasn't doing this in a bratty way, he was doing it when prompted. He was having a hard time conjuring the sad face because he was laughing haha...

All in all a fantastic day of sunshine, home cooked food, home brewed bear, and of course, a fabulous and loving family. Hope you all had as nice an Easter weekend! And happy April Fools day, hope you don't get pranked too bad :)
