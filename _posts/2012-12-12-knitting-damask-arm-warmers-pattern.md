I have made many, many arm warmers in my day. And I love them, I have one pair that I wear almost every single day in the winter time. The reason I particularly love this style of arm warmer is because they are incredibly simple... there is no thumb hole, which not only makes them quicker and easier to make, but also means that you still have full use of your hands while still benefiting from a great deal of extra warmth. I like fingerless gloves and mitts and whatnot, but I have to admit I wear these way more because they're far less inhibiting when it comes to things like washing one's hands. All you have to do is pull them up a bit, you don't have to take them off every single time. Plus I just don't like the sweaty palm situation that tends to happen with gloves and mitts. The length of these is just perfect... They're basically like very warm sleeve extenders.

Because I love them so much, I decided to go ahead and write a pattern to share with ya'll. Enjoy, and please let me know if there are any corrections or clarifications that could be made!

### Size

{:/}

### Finished Measurements

Circumference: 7”

Length: 6 ½”

### Materials

#### Yarn

Any sport weight yarn. Approximately 120 yds of MC, 75 yds CC

#### Needles

Set of four US size 4 (3.50mm) dpns, or size needed to obtain gauge

Set of four US size 2 (2.75mm) dpns, or two sizes smaller than gauge needle

#### Notions

Yarn needle

#### Gauge

26 sts and 32 rows = 4” / 10 cm in charted pattern in the round using larger needle

### Pattern Notes

#### Abbreviations

* BO - Bind off
* CC - Contrast color
* CO - Cast on
* dpn(s) - Double pointed needle(s)
* k - Knit
* MC - Main color
* p - Purl
* rnd - Round
* st(s) = Stitch(es)

####  Important:

When working the charted pattern, in order to keep sts consistent and have the design stand out as much as possible **always carry CC yarn on the right and MC yarn on the left.** In other words, the CC should consistently be carried so it's floats are on top, and the MC floats on bottom in the back of your work.

## Directions

### Make two arm warmers as follows:

#### Beginning Cuff

With smaller needles and MC, CO 48 sts evenly across 3 dpns. Join for working in the rnd, being careful not to twist.

Work in ribbing as set for ¾”.

#### Working Charted Pattern

Using larger needles, with MC k 2 rnds.

Work rows 1-40 of charted pattern. Chart repeats twice across each rnd.

With MC k 2 rnds.

#### Ending Cuff

Continue using larger needles and MC.

Ribbing: [k1, p1] around.

Work in ribbing as set for ¾”.

BO very loosely, preferably using a stretchy method such as the sewn BO. For info on sewn BO, see [here](http://knitty.com/ISSUEsummer06/FEATsum06TT.html) (at the bottom.)
