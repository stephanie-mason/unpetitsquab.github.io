Last week my darling SO was amazing, and installed the wood stove I mentioned previously. He put up an old stainless steel counter up as a heat shield, and it has been working very well. When the stove is going full tilt you can put your hand behind there and it's still comfortable, especially down at the bottom where the beefed up heat shields are.

It is so nice to have dry, warm, wood stove heat. It has to be stoked pretty frequently, with fairly small pieces of wood, but considering you only have to travel about 7 feet maximum to stoke it... not such a big deal. This is a stove that was made for boat cabins, and it makes a lot of sense in our little space. Well, as much sense as putting an incredible fire hazard in a very tiny space with most of your worldy possessions can make. I am still very happy with it.
