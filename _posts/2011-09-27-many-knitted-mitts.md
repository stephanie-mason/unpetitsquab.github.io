I have posted about arm warmers, gloves, etc. I’ve made before. Here are some more. I have loved making these small, quick knitted items for the last year or three.

And! I’ve started selling some of them on etsy!

Some of the patterns for the fair isle nordic stars and such and such I find online or in books, and some of them (such as the sailboats and swallows) I made up myself.
