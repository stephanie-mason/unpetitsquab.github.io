Last night, during the a pretty crazy wind storm, Jason and I were sitting in the Vardo muching away at our dinner when we heard a crack in the woods. We both looked at each other and were listening to what was obviously a tree falling, both of us thinking it was at a short distance away (probably the other side of the stream.) All of the sudden there was a huge crash and the whole vardo shook. My immediate thought was that a branch had fallen on the roof. Jason's eyes went wide and he panic-scarfed down the rest of his burger, and we both jumped up and ran outside with flashlights. (By the way-the power was out already.) I looked at the roof and saw, sure enough, a big branch sticking up. But I was a little confused because of how it was angled. We both ran around the outside of the vardo, and low and behold-- this was no branch but a huge freaking TREE that had fallen literally inches away from the vardo.

Or at least, a very big piece of a tree.

That came from waaaay up here.

A few feet from where we had been sitting. It clipped the little wood shed we have at the hitch end of the vardo, and it obliterated the greenhouse. Be both looked at each other in astonishment and came to the same conclusion: had it fallen a few feet further over, it would have totally crushed the vardo and probably killed us both. Crazy!

It also managed to crush the corner of the goat pen. Thankfully no one, including the goats, were hurt. They were a little shaken after their house shifted a few feet, though they quickly got over it when they realized that there were tree branches hanging in their pen they could snack on.

Anyway, that was a pretty little bit of excitement last night. We were both so worked up about it we decided to go ahead and drive into town and spend the night at Jason's parents, lest any other trees decide to topple over in the night.
