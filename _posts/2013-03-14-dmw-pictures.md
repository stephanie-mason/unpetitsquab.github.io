I feel very lucky to live in a community so full of artistic, talented people. During a few of our shows, we had some incredible photographers show up and take some just beautiful photos of the show.

One of these photographers is Tristan Limpo, who I was very excited to see captured some moments of the show that I never get to watch. Here are a few of my favorites!

Another fantastic photographer, Jorge Lausell, is always showing up to circus events and making us look our best.

Did you know that tomorrow is our last show?! It is at the Lincoln Theater in Mt Vernon, and it is _your last chance_ to come see the show! I mean, look at those pictures... do you really want to miss it? No.
