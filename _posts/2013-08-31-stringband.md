A few weeks ago I went to the 13th annual (and my 4th annual) [Subdued Stringband Jamboree](http://www.stringbandjamboree.com/2014/index.php), which is a local music festival up here in Bellingham. It was a very enjoyable, relaxing weekend spent amongst friends and lovely music. Here are just a few moments from that lovely weekend. Rose, my incredibly talented, smart, crafty, beautiful genius of a friend created these lovely teepees for us to camp out/hang out/ get out of the sun in and it was magical having such a notable camp site. There were several times during the weekend in which people were instructed to find one of us by "looking for the teepees" and it worked out well. Some of my favorite circus people performed, and while not all my photos came out that great I did manage to snag a few.

Stringband is always so wonderful because it sort of marks the winding down of summer for me. It is the most laidback festival I attend all year, and even though the [Sh'Bang](http://shbangfest.com/) is still on it's way here in September, Stringband feels like the last. By the time Stringband is done, and all other summer fun has been had, I'm ready to bunker down and get ready for fall and winter--meaning be a little less social and a little more cozy at home. Each season brings it's own mood for me, and summer is one of lots of party fun time with friends. Winter is when I like to spend more time focusing on creativity and staying out of the rain. I'm getting the creative (slash antisocial) bug, and am ready for rainy weather to push me indoors to make things happen with all of my projects. Including some more things for this blog, although a lot of my focus is going to be on some side projects.
