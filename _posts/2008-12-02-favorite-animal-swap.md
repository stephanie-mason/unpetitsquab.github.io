I recently did a swap on Craftster.org, and the theme was *Craft a Favorite Animal.* Meaning I gave my partner my top 3 favorite animals for her to craft for me, and she gave me her top 3 for me to craft for her. Her top three were
1. Skunks
2. Dragonflies
3. Bats

So this is what I made for her.

So for Skunks we have a wood burning I did on a plaque:

The lady I made them for has a pet skunk who is mostly white with brown patches, hence the way the skunks I crafted look :)

And for Dragonlflies, I did the felted one on the nose above and also this ornament, which was a pretty simple thing to make:
