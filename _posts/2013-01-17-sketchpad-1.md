For Christmas this year, I drew two of my siblings up some hilarity.

My brother, Devin, has a degree in psychology and also likes dragons. Therefore he received a picture of Dragon-freud.

Clea received a picture of something I thought of as part of a joke one day, and I decided some day she would need to have a picture of it because she can truly appreciate it. It is the chick-o-griff.

Which is like a hippogriff, but clearly more magnificent due to it having a chicken's head instead of the less glorious eagle head usually seen.

Both drawn with Sakura Micron pens.
