The next post I make will have pictures of a swap I did on Craftster. But its not done yet, so I'll post the pictures after we've both received our goodies and I have pictures of what she sent me as well!

Also, I will soon be posting pictures of holiday crafts I've been working on. Lots of fun stuff!
