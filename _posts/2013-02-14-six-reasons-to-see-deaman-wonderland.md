As the show gets closer, rehearsals have become more and more frequent and most of my time for the next few weeks is gonna be going into act rehearsal and costume creation, so updates on the blog might be a tad more sparse. But I've got some great stuff planned, and will be posting that when I have spare moments.

In the meantime, here are six reasons why you should see [Deadman Wonderland Circus](http://www.deadmanwonderlandcircus.com).

1. For the sass.

2. For the ass.

3. For the bear.

4. There is real circus in it!

5. There will also be this.

6. And obviously, to see naked Jules play with his ball.

On an almost completely unrelated note, this is what my brother ate _for breakfast_ the other day. I believe he eats this regularly. He ate nothing but this for breakfast.

What do you think about that? Do you find it horrific, as I do?
