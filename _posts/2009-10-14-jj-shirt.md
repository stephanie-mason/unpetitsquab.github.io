I'm so satisfied right now, this is the first article of clothing I've made that actually looks like I didn't make it.The pattern came from [Burda Style](http://www.burdastyle.com/projects/jj), and is free. Yay free stuff! And here are some more shots, because I'm just so happy with how it turned out.
