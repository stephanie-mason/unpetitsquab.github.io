Ate a decent breakfast, with vegetables, for a change.

Had plenty of cuteness in my day to day life.

Watched a Deadman Photoshoot, this one of my big brother is for the ladies... (Namely our mother, grandmother, you know, the ladies who are so dang proud of their son/grandson for being such a talented and handsome fellow. Sorry other ladies, but he's taken.)

And endured even more cuteness. The horror...
