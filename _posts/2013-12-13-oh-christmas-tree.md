Today I went with my sister and step mom to pick out the family's Christmas tree. (I say my family's tree because sadly, living in a tiny house does not afford much in the way of indoor Christmas trees. Dont' be too sad for me, though. I like to think of the 50 foot tall firs outside my house as my Christmas Trees ;))

Ain't my sister gorgeous?

We have a winner

I like to think of this as revenge (for the tree trying to kill us before.)

Beautiful Leslie and her hand knitted goodness

"How tall am I?" "Well... Just over 5 1/2 feet, does that sound about right?"

There was a very charming pooch at the tree farm

I also thought these squirrels hanging out in the bird feeders at my parent's house were pretty noteworthy

We always go to the Christmas tree farm [River's Edge](http://www.riversedgeucut.com/index.html) in Deming because they let you cut your own and have nice lookin' trees. I enjoy going and spending time with them looking at the trees and getting into the spirit of the holiday.
