So in the last few weeks I finally managed to finish sweaters for my  boyfriend and myself that I cast on for about one and two years ago respectively. Both of these sweaters were extremely boring to knit, but I'm pretty happy with the results.The boyfriend:

This was made sort of using a pattern from [Knitty](http://www.knitty.com/) called [Patch Pocket Raglan](http://knitty.com/ISSUEfall07/PATTppr.html), but there are very few similarities. I took off the patches, I altered the pattern for a different weight yarn, and I changed the neck and the sleeves. The bottom is the same, though, as well as next to the seams it has the same sort of inverted line of stitches. The me:

And this here sweater was made from the pattern [Tubey](http://knitty.com/ISSUEwinter05/PATTtubey.html), again from Knitty. I swear I don't only knit patterns from Knitty! I do pay for patterns occasionally and have knitting books I go from. For instance, I have a sweater in the works right now from Twist Collective called Little Birds.

However, I'm changing it up a bit. I love the idea of little birds on a sweater, but I'm a sucker for swallows (I have tattoos of swallows on my feet) so I had to alter the pattern. Here's my swatch of the fair isle bit (which I haven't started on the actual sweater yet.)

I also have a mini bolero I am working on from  a pattern in a Japanese knitting book called *Knit Wardrobe: Autumn/Winter vol.2* but I don't have pictures of it not in its very beginning stages, and I pretty much finished it today. I just need to add buttons/weave in ends, and I'm trying to decide whether or not to add the piqued edge the pattern calls for or not.Thats all for now!
