Have I mentioned that I have been knitting a lot lately?

This may be due to the fact that the weather is turning cold and knitting is just what I tend to do this time of year. Or it may have to do with the fact that I somewhat recently acquired a job at a yarn store.

This is something my boss gave me some yarn to make. I invented it myself. Well, it was actually sort of inspired by something in a book. And the stitch pattern came from another book. But I did make up the thing as it is. This kerchief.
