These are classically attractive, stylish, and dare-I-say sexy stockings. They are intended to be worn with garters. Why garters? Because it's realistic. One could easily sew elastic into the band, and they would likely stay up for a time, but my experience of even commercially made thigh high socks is that they will inevitably slouch due to the anatomy of legs being rather triangle like*.

Plus, garters are the bees knees. They do their job, they do it well, and they have a very old fashioned sexy appeal to them. And old fashioned sexy is way better than new fashioned sexy, don't you think?

But don't get me wrong, these stockings are not over the top. They are very wearable with every day outfits, and if you make them in black they look just like a favorite pair of tights.

Only better than tights, because they are made of extremely warm and comfortable wool. And what pair of commercially made tights looks this exciting in the back?

The answer is none tights.

I hope you enjoy! If you have any questions about the pattern, the instructions, or anything else, do not hesitate to contact me.

*I have also seen stocking patterns claiming to be held up with ribbon, and that is the biggest load of bull crap ever. Have you ever tried to tie a ribbon around your thigh? First of all, the whole "string cutting into the fattiest cellulite part of your body" thing doesn't seem like something most women I know are very keen on, and also, no matter how tight you tie them, they still immediately fall down.*
