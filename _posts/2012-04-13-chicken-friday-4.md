This week was gooood.

First of all, Saturday was the first day of the Farmer’s Market!

Which is basically my favorite day of the year. I only got to stop by for a few minutes before and after work, but boy do I love it there! Without fail, I get to run into at least five people I like every time I go, and it’s awesome to see circus and musician friends busking and making bank. The fact that it was the nicest day this year is also a perk.

Then Sunday was Easter, which meant getting together with the fam. As you can see below, craftiness is something that runs through my blood and is not simply an acquired skillset:

That is my lovely Aunt Kitty with her incredible Easter centerpiece creation! Beautiful.

And of course this week was filled with glorious Chicken time. Chickens are like little vegetables, and revel in sunlight. They got to go on a few adventures this week out into grassy areas.

Those little suckers are growing very quickly, and while they are still on the small side of being chicken-y, they are very soon in need of being outdoors running around.

Jackish is still a pretty great chicken, but she’s got some competition for being number-one chicken with this little lady here:

This chicken still doesn’t have a name, but is becoming quite the standout little chicken. She is the most unique looking of the chickens. She is also rather inquisitive and very fun to watch, as she is not the least bit shy and will walk right up to us each time we open up the coop to check out whats going on. She’s also quite tame! Now we just need to figure out a name to suit her glorious nature.

Other than that this week was a rather boring work week with a sprinkle… well, more of a heavy shower… of spring cleaning. There was also quite a bit of work done on the Caravan, but more on that next week!
