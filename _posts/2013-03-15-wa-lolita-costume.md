We performed our last show last night! It went fantastically, and while I am fairly happy to be done with the project and able to focus on other things, I am still very happy with how it came out and with having participated.

For the whole show, the majority of outfits on stage I either made, collaborated on, or altered in some way. It was a huge undertaking, and I learned a lot during the process. One of my favorite costumes was my own, because I had complete creative control over it and because it's just more fun for me to make pretty girly things.

I knew early on that I wanted to wear something Lolita inspired, and as my character and the show developed I decided that Wa Lolita was the way to go as it fit the overall aesthetic better than the more cutesy and Victorian Lolita styles. I had to alter some aspects of the fashion to make it something I could wear while doing acro on stage, but I feel pretty good about staying pretty true to the overall concept. I'm pretty stoked how it came out.

I admit that the weakest part of this costume is probably the back. I wish I had put some interfacing in the bow to make it stand up a bit more, and hidden underneath the bow I had to use elastic because I needed to be able to have _something_ stretch for my back bends.

Overall, it worked really well on stage. The sleeves worked beautifully for some of the choreography, and it was pretty easy to move around in. I'm also pretty proud to have made it because I drafted the whole thing from scratch (admittedly not a very difficult task, as it was more or less all rectangles... But still, fun!)
