I have decided that I want to start posting about more things in my life outside of crafting. This is due to the fact that there is so much to my life, and not enough opportunity for me to share it with everyone who may (or may not) be interested. Namely family.

So here is the start of what I like to call Chicken Friday. Chicken Friday is about me and my partner’s newest venture: Chickens! Let me show you our chickens:

Holy crap, they’re cute. That is THREE baby chickens right there. Not two. Three.

I’ll get back to them in a second. Chicken Friday isn’t just going to be about chickens. I mean chickens are, I assume, pretty boring to anyone who isn’t raising them. Sure, they’re cute now that they’re all tiny and beady eyed. But how many weeks of chicken can anyone take?

Well there’s going to be little updates about the chickens on Fridays. There will, along side of pictures and updates about the chickens, also be general updates about the goings on in my life. This will keep the few people interested in chickens coming back, and the few people interested in me (namely family) also coming back! Its a win win situation. There will still be regular craft updates, and I’m also planning on making fairly regular updates about a few other specific side projects.

This chicken Friday, however, is all about the chickens. I think there are a few people who are probably already sick of hearing about the chickens (namely family) but there are some people who don’t even know that I have chickens yet!

Here are the chickens:

CHICKEN LINE! Our chickens are Blue Old English Bantams. This means they’re going to be small, scheming chickens who will lay tiny eggs in places where we cannot find them.

This is Bonnie! (S)he’s my favorite so far. A very relaxed chicken who doesn’t have much qualm with being held.

This is (unnoficially) Jackish. Named as such because of its resemblance to Jack Skelington.

This is Charles. Maybe.

This chicken has no name yet.

This is Astrid! Named after my lovely sister Clea, whose middle name is Astrid. Also a favorite.

And this is Lovefeather, jokingly named after my brother.

These chickens may all look the same to you, and you may be wondering how I can tell them apart. I can barely tell them apart. After much studying of their faces, I have developed a system of distinguishing between them. Its exciting to watch them as they each develop their own little personalities as well. For example, Jackish is a little fatso. Any food you put in there and s(he) is, without fail, the first little one on there scratching away. And Lovefeather, s(he) is a little complainer. Anything that is out of place and s(he) is the first one to be peeping loudly away about what bullshit it is.

Our plan is to mostly keep these chickens as pets. Also eat their tiny little eggs. Also, Jason will probably eventually eat them, especially the ones that turn out to be less-than-personable roosters. I myself am still a vegetarian… but I have learned to accept the grim inevitability of life and the grim inevitability in the life of a chicken is that you will probably, some day, be eaten. For now, though, they are very well cared for. They even have a sweet little house—with windows!—which Jason built for them. I will post more about that next week.

That is all for this Chicken Friday!
