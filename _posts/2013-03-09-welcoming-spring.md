Tomorrow is spring! I can hardly believe, it, I am so excited. The weather the last few days has been marvelous... I've been able to sneak a few barefoot moments outside already.

I tend to spend most warmer days barefoot as much as possible. I'm not a barefoot-ist, per se, I do prefer to wear shoes in stores and downtown and such... But anywhere there is grass, dirt, or stone, I prefer to have the toes out and feeling the earth. I just don't _always_ prefer it when it's cold, mucky, and wet.

We have been very inspired by spring around here. Jason has been building away. He whipped up this beauty in a matter of hours.

The man is good with power tools.

We wasted no time filling it with dirt and stuffing some vegetable starts in there.

We have garlic, some herbs, and some lettuce.

And to my delight, nothing has withered away and died yet. My epxerience with gardening is that I have absolutely no experience gardening, and while I have sworn for several years now that I'd get into it and research it (I like to research everything to death before starting new projects) I never seem to get around to it. Jason knows a bit, and so we're just winging it. It's kind of fun, I'm gonna be learning as I go! At any rate, the garden is doing wonders to make the outside of the Vardo look more lively.

Less trashy than it has the potential to be.

We're also going to plant a tree in that big pot to the left there, and there's another pot that we put some goldfish in and are gonna have some floating plants and such.

Oh, and big news guys. Jason and I decided to have kids!

This is Mordecai

This is Wednesday

Spring fever I guess you could say. We picked these LaMancha wethers up yesterday from [Gothberg Farms](http://www.gothbergfarms.com/), and they were too cute not to photograph. Although I will warn you, while they are cute and we did give them names, they _are_ destined for the dinner table down the line, so I don't advise getting attached. I don't believe that means we can't enjoy small doses of their hilarious little goaty antics now, though!

Mordecai sucks.

Wednesday chews his hide.

Calliope was rather excited about the goats, and was instantly trying to play with them... which unfortunately involves her chasing them around and spooking them a bit too much at their age (a week!), so she didn't get to spend too much time out with them yet. Franki, however, just doesn't know what to make of them. She has oscillated between playing, being wary of, and just outright ignoring these strangle little guys.

What _are_ you?!

Jason, of course, whipped up this super sweet little house and fenced off an area for them to grow up in until they're old enough to be put in with the other animals we live with.

This is made out of palettes and some other scraps of things.
