## Zipper Pouch Sewing Tutorial

### Materials

* about 1/4 yard of main fabric, I used a durable canvas
* about 1/4 yard of lining fabric, could be anything
* 10" or longer coordinating zipper

### Step One: Cut Fabric

Cut your main fabric into two rectangles that are each 7" x 5", and your lining fabric into a piece that is 7" x 10"

### Step Two: Sew Long Sides with WS Facing

With WRONG sides facing, sew the long ends of the main fabric to the lining fabric as shown above, and finish the outside edges of the whole large rectangle.

### Step Three: Sew Zipper to One End

Pin the zipper face down to the seam between the main fabric and the lining fabric, lining the edge of the zipper up with the edge of the seam, and stitch close to the zipper using a zipper foot. Like so:

Fold it back and press.

### Step Four: Sew Zipper to the Other End

You are now going to wrap the  lining around so the other main fabric/lining seam can be sewn to the other side of the zipper just like the first side. It will be easier if to sew if you open the zipper.

### Step Five: Sew Around the Edge

Next you are going to fold from the middle of the lining the whole thing in half and seam around the edge leaving a turning hole. It will be sort of confusing to describe, so just check out this picture.

You will basically be seaming on three sides, but there will be a 2" gap on the side where the right sides of the main fabric meet. Be careful when you are sewing over the zipper, make sure the actual zipper is inside the pouch area and use the hand crank so you don't break your needle on the teeth.

Sew to the corner, turn, and sew about 2" in towards the middle and stop. It will look like this:

Repeat that for the other side. At the end you will have a nice little gap in the top:

### Step Six: Turn in Inside Out and Close the Hole

Once you turn it inside out everything will start to look tidy. You can press out all the corners and push the lining into the main fabric. You'll have a hole in the bottom that will look like this:

Use a [blind stitch ](http://quilttaffy.blogspot.com/2008/07/invisible-closing-seam-tutorial.html)to close that hole right on up.

And that's it! You are now done with your pouch. Put your knitting accessories in it, slip it in your knitting bag, and you're good to go.
