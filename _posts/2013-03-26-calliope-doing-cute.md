Lately Calliope has been doing this totally adorable thing. Down the street where we play fetch, there is a plastic crate filled with rain water that the dogs usually go drink out of on fetch-breaks. Calliope always drops her ball in it so it's nearby while she's drinking, and over the course of the last few weeks she's gone from simple dunking her head in to get the ball out, to putting her front legs in...

To fully stepping in and just hanging out.

I think it is the silliest cutest thing. She'll often hop out only to drop her ball back in there, and then she'll circle around in there to get back at it. I don't think she fully understands how water works. She's been swimming maybe two or three times now and still is pretty funny/worried around water. I think she likes to cool off in the crate without having to swim... It's like her own personal kiddie pool.

That is all, just cute dog photos.
