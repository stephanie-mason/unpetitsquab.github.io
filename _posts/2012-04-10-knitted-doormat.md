The thing about living out here in the semi-wilderness is that it is incredibly muddy here in the rainier months of the year. This leads to mud, dirt, and any number of debris being tracked all over one’s shipping container room, and in the future one’s tiny house. This is why before I even moved out there I created this little door mat.

This poor little rug has been no match for the vast quantities of muck that get dragged into our room, but it does gather quite a bit of what would otherwise also need to be swept up. Plus, it’s super cute.

I washed it the other day in a washing machine I made out of a bucket and some rocks! We here at the Lookout Arts Quarry like to eschew all modern conveniences. Why? Um… Because it makes us look cool?

Made out of old sheets/scraps of fabric that I cut into long strips and then knitted using some ridiculously large plastic needles, utilizing the ultra-fancy “garter stitch.”
