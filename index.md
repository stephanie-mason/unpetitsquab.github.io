# Adventures in knitting, programming, and design

Welcome to my little corner of the interwebs. Here is where I collect all the things I'm working on, have worked on, and hope to be working on in the future.

Speaking of, under [work](/work) you will find various projects that I have either designed, worked on with others, or been involved with in some capacity.

The [blog](/blog) is where I occasionally become enthusiastic about talking about whatever is going on in my life before disappearing for months/years at a time.

And you can find out a little bit more [about](/about) me in the obvious place.

[E-mail](mailto:stephanie@unpetitsquab.com) is by far the best way to get in touch with me. I'm really on top of my e-mail.
